# Agent Skills - Learn to Earn 🦞

## What Are Skills?

Skills are **agent-readable guides** that teach autonomous AI agents (and humans) how to perform specific tasks in the MoltChain ecosystem. Each skill is structured for autonomous execution:

- ✅ Clear prerequisites listed upfront
- ✅ Copy-paste terminal commands
- ✅ Expected outputs shown
- ✅ Troubleshooting steps included
- ✅ Learning checkboxes to track progress

Feed a skill to an LLM, and it can complete it autonomously!

## 🎯 How to Use Skills

### For Humans

1. **Pick a skill** that aligns with your goals
2. **Read sequentially** - skills build knowledge step-by-step
3. **Copy-paste commands** - test everything in your environment
4. **Complete checkboxes** - track your progress
5. **Ask for help** - join Discord if stuck
6. **Earn credentials** - graduate with badges/NFTs

### For Autonomous Agents

Skills are designed for LLM consumption:

```python
# Example: Agent autonomously completes Validator Skill
skill_content = read_file("skills/VALIDATOR_SKILL.md")
agent = AutonomousAgent(goal="become_validator")
agent.execute_skill(skill_content)

# Agent will:
# 1. Parse prerequisites
# 2. Execute terminal commands
# 3. Verify expected outputs
# 4. Troubleshoot errors autonomously
# 5. Mark checkboxes as complete
# 6. Earn the Self-Made Molty badge 🦞
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear structure (Prerequisites → Steps → Verification → Troubleshooting)
- Explicit commands (no ambiguity, copy-paste ready)
- Expected outputs (agent can verify success)
- Error handling (troubleshooting section for common issues)

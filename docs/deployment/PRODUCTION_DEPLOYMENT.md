# Lichen Deployment Runbook

This is the current operator runbook for the repo as it exists today.

Use this document as the canonical workflow for:

- local validator development via `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh`
- local production-parity stack validation via `scripts/start-local-stack.sh`
- VPS validator deployment via `deploy/setup.sh`
- local full-stack extension when custody, faucet, and browser flows are needed
- genesis DB creation and post-genesis bootstrap
- signed release and signed metadata generation
- local ZK proof generation

This runbook intentionally prefers the scripts that are verified in the current tree over older narrative docs.

## Supported operator paths

| Workflow | Supported entrypoint |
| --- | --- |
| **VPS clean-slate redeploy** | `scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh testnet` |
| Local validator development | `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh` |
| **Local production-parity stack** | `scripts/start-local-stack.sh testnet` |
| VPS initial provisioning | `deploy/setup.sh` |

`deploy/setup.sh` is now responsible for the public edge as well: it installs the checked-in Caddy config from `deploy/Caddyfile.*`, enables the `caddy` service, uses internal TLS for Cloudflare-origin traffic, and keeps raw RPC, WebSocket, faucet, and custody ports off the public firewall surface.

## TLS termination model

Production RPC and WebSocket listeners do not terminate TLS inside the Rust services.
The supported production shape is:

- Cloudflare or another trusted edge in front of the node
- Caddy on the origin host terminating HTTPS and WSS with the checked-in `deploy/Caddyfile.*` configs
- local origin proxying from Caddy to the raw app listeners on `127.0.0.1`
- firewall rules that keep raw RPC and WS ports off the public internet

Current checked-in origin mappings are:

- mainnet: `rpc.lichen.network -> 127.0.0.1:9899`, `ws.lichen.network -> 127.0.0.1:9900`
- testnet: `testnet-rpc.lichen.network -> 127.0.0.1:8899`, `testnet-ws.lichen.network -> 127.0.0.1:8900`

Operational rule: direct exposure of the raw RPC or WebSocket listeners is unsupported for production. If Caddy or the firewall posture is missing, the node is not in a production-ready network shape even if the Rust services are running.

## Supporting scripts

| Task | Supporting script |
| --- | --- |
| **Full automated VPS redeploy** | `scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh` |
| Local full stack extension | `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` |
| Local full-stack stop/status | `scripts/stop-local-stack.sh`, `scripts/status-local-stack.sh` |
| Genesis wallet + DB creation | `scripts/generate-genesis.sh` |
| Post-genesis bootstrap | `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` |
| VPS post-genesis keypair copy | `scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh` |
| Manual single-node debugging | `lichen-start.sh` |
| Release signing | `scripts/generate-release-keys.sh`, `scripts/sign-release.sh` |
| Signed metadata manifest | `scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js` |
| Health check | `scripts/health-check.sh` |
| Cloudflare Pages deploy | `scripts/deploy-cloudflare-pages.sh` |
| ZK proof generation | `target/release/zk-prove` |

Important distinctions:

- `run-validator.sh` is a local-development helper behind the 3-validator launcher, not a supported operator entrypoint on its own.
- `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` extends the supported local validator path with custody, faucet, and post-genesis bootstrap.
- `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` is post-genesis bootstrap only. Genesis itself deploys the contract catalog.
- `lichen-start.sh` is for manual foreground debugging only, not part of the supported operator runbook.

## Local parity contract

The repo supports two different local workflows, and they are not interchangeable:

- `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh` is for validator and consensus development. It is intentionally lighter than VPS deployment.
- `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` is the supported local analog for production-like stack validation.

If you are trying to answer "will this behave like the VPS deployment except for being disposable?", use `scripts/start-local-stack.sh`, not the validator-only launcher.

Production-parity rule:

- The acceptable difference between local parity runs and VPS runs is disposability and host orchestration.
- Local parity runs may use repo-local data paths, shell-managed processes, and loopback networking.
- Local parity runs must still use the same release binaries, the same genesis flow, the same post-genesis bootstrap, the same contract artifacts, the same signed-metadata generation path, the same custody/faucet services, and the same keypair-password policy.

Current status of that contract in this repo:

| Concern | Local 3-validator | Local full stack | VPS deployment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3-validator consensus shape | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Release validator binary | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Genesis + post-genesis bootstrap | Partial | Yes | Yes |
| Custody service | No | Yes | Yes |
| Faucet service | No | Yes on testnet | Yes on US testnet host |
| Signed metadata manifest refresh | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Same encrypted-keypair path when `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` is exported | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Public ingress via Caddy / Cloudflare | No | No | Yes |
| systemd ownership of services | No | No | Yes |
| Disposable reset to clean genesis | Yes | Yes | No by default |

Operational consequence:

- Do not treat `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh` as a production-representative environment.
- Treat `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` as the required local gate for production-like E2E and matrix work.
- Treat VPS or staging deployment as the final gate for systemd, ingress, firewall, and long-lived-state behavior.

Workflow parity rule:

- The parity model is seed-first, not "three equivalent local validators".
- Validator 1 or seed-01 creates genesis and owns the first post-genesis bootstrap.
- Validators 2 and 3 are joiners against that already-created chain.
- Local parity work is only considered valid when it follows that same logical sequence before tests run.

Phase-by-phase equivalence:

| Phase | Local full stack | VPS clean-slate redeploy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reset state | Reset repo-local `data/state-*` paths before launch when a fresh chain is required | Stop services and wipe `/var/lib/lichen/*` before redeploy |
| Seed genesis | Validator 1 creates or refreshes local genesis state and emits the genesis key material used by the stack | `seed-01` creates the new genesis state and writes the canonical genesis key material |
| Joiners come online | Validators 2 and 3 start against the already-created chain and join over the local network | `seed-02` and `seed-03` start after seed genesis and join the canonical chain |
| Post-genesis bootstrap | `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` waits for the genesis artifacts and then runs `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` | `scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh` runs `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` on `seed-01` after genesis |
| Auxiliary services | Custody and faucet start from the genesis-derived local key material | Custody and faucet start from the seed host's provisioned key material |
| Validation gate | Run E2E and matrix workloads against the local stack, then rerun without reset | Run final staging or VPS verification for systemd, ingress, firewall, and long-lived state |

Current implementation note:

- The logical workflow is the same, but the joiner bring-up mechanism is not identical yet.
- The local parity path starts all three validators on the same host and lets validators 2 and 3 join over loopback.
- The VPS clean-slate redeploy currently snapshots post-genesis state from `seed-01` before bringing up the other VPSes.
- That difference is an operator automation optimization, not a different genesis or bootstrap model, and it does not replace the VPS gate for service-orchestration behavior.

## Network selection and public ingress

- Local browser workflows default to `local-testnet`.
- Production portals default to `mainnet` and call `https://rpc.lichen.network` unless the operator or user explicitly selects `testnet`.
- Public testnet RPC lives at `https://testnet-rpc.lichen.network`.
- A healthy testnet redeploy does not make the production portals healthy if `rpc.lichen.network` or its Cloudflare/Caddy/origin path is down.
- Browser CORS, incident-status, signed-metadata, and symbol-registry errors on the portals can be caused by an ingress failure first. A Cloudflare `502` is surfaced by browsers as a CORS-style failure because the error page is not the RPC app.

## Prerequisites

Install these before running any of the workflows below:

- Rust toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Node.js for signed metadata manifest generation
- Python 3 with `venv` support for the repo Python tools
- `curl` and `python3`
- On VPSes, a Rust install that can be loaded in non-login shells via `. "$HOME/.cargo/env"`

Deployment helper note:

- `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` now bootstraps `.venv` from `sdk/python/requirements.txt` if the required Python modules are missing, but it still requires `python3 -m venv` to work.

Recommended setup from repo root:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || true
cargo build --release --bin lichen-validator --bin lichen-genesis --bin lichen-faucet --bin lichen-custody --bin lichen --bin zk-prove
./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh
```

If you want the repo-wide convenience build instead:

```bash
make build
```

## Paths and outputs

Know the path conventions before you start:

| Environment | Validator state |
| --- | --- |
| Local validator 1 | `data/state-7001` on testnet, `data/state-8001` on mainnet |
| Local validator 2 | `data/state-7002` on testnet, `data/state-8002` on mainnet |
| Local validator 3 | `data/state-7003` on testnet, `data/state-8003` on mainnet |
| VPS / systemd | `/var/lib/lichen/state-testnet` or `/var/lib/lichen/state-mainnet` |

Other important outputs:

- local signed metadata manifest: `signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json` or `signed-metadata-manifest-mainnet.json`
- local full-stack logs: `/tmp/lichen-local-testnet` or `/tmp/lichen-local-mainnet`
- deploy manifest: `deploy-manifest.json`
- VPS validator envs: `/etc/lichen/env-testnet` and `/etc/lichen/env-mainnet`
- VPS custody envs: `/etc/lichen/custody-env` and `/etc/lichen/custody-env-mainnet`

## Keypair password policy

Outside explicit local development, set `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` before the first validator, genesis, custody, or signer start and keep the same value available on every restart.

Operational rules:

- canonical validator, treasury, genesis-primary, and signer keypair JSON files are encrypted at rest when `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` is set
- production loaders now refuse plaintext keypair files unless `LICHEN_LOCAL_DEV=1` or `LICHEN_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_KEYPAIRS=1` is explicitly set
- local launchers still allow plaintext compatibility for throwaway development, but the secure local E2E path should export `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` so the same code path is exercised before redeploy
- any helper copy of a keypair file must preserve owner-only permissions; use the checked-in scripts rather than ad hoc `cp`

## Local Runbook

### Local 3-validator cluster

Use this when you want the verified multi-validator path with signed metadata generation and nothing else.

This is not the production-parity local deployment. It is a validator-focused developer workflow.

Start from a clean state:

```bash
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='local-e2e-secret'
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh start-reset
```

Reuse an existing cluster without resetting state:

```bash
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh start
```

Check health:

```bash
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh status
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8901 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8903 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
```

Stop the cluster:

```bash
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh stop
```

What this launcher does:

- starts 3 validators through `run-validator.sh`
- creates local genesis state on validator 1 when needed
- writes validator state under `data/state-7001`, `data/state-7002`, `data/state-7003`
- generates a signed metadata manifest once the cluster is healthy

What it does not do:

- it does not start custody or faucet
- it does not manage local stack status outside validator health
- it does not mirror the VPS service layout closely enough for release-signoff E2E work

### Local full stack

Use this when you want the closest supported local analog to the VPS deployment while keeping the stack disposable.

This is the local production-parity path for E2E and matrix validation.

The required local interpretation is:

- validator 1 creates genesis
- validators 2 and 3 join that chain
- custody and faucet come up against that chain
- `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` performs the same post-genesis bootstrap that the seed VPS performs before production-like tests run

Start:

```bash
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='local-e2e-secret'
./scripts/start-local-stack.sh testnet
```

Status:

```bash
./scripts/status-local-stack.sh testnet
```

Stop:

```bash
./scripts/stop-local-stack.sh testnet
```

What the full-stack launcher does, in order:

- starts validator 1 and establishes genesis state
- starts validators 2 and 3 as joiners
- waits for the genesis treasury and deployer key material to appear
- starts custody service
- starts faucet service on testnet
- runs `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` against the healthy chain

What still differs from VPS deployment:

- processes are shell-managed rather than owned by systemd
- state lives under repo-local `data/state-*` paths rather than `/var/lib/lichen/*`
- ingress is loopback-only and does not include Caddy or Cloudflare
- SSH, firewall, service-user, and origin-edge behavior are not part of the local stack
- VPS joiners are currently brought up from distributed post-genesis state, while local joiners attach over the already-running local network

What must not differ for production-like testing:

- release binaries and contract artifacts
- genesis and first-boot bootstrap behavior
- custody/faucet/runtime feature set
- signed metadata generation path
- encrypted keypair handling when `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` is set

Where to look for logs:

```bash
ls /tmp/lichen-local-testnet
```

### Local verification checklist

After starting either local flow, verify the chain before moving on:

```bash
bash tests/local-multi-validator-test.sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899/api/v1/pairs | python3 -m json.tool
ls -l signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

If you want to reuse an already-running cluster in the validator test harness:

```bash
LICHEN_REUSE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=1 bash tests/local-multi-validator-test.sh
```

Keep `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` exported while running Python or SDK-driven E2Es against that cluster. The helper files under `keypairs/` and `data/state-*/genesis-keys/` may now be encrypted canonical keypair JSON, and the SDK loader uses the same password to open them.

For production-like validation, the minimum local gate is:

1. Run `scripts/start-local-stack.sh testnet` from a clean reset.
2. Run the intended E2E or matrix workload.
3. Re-run the same workload without resetting state to catch reused-signer, reused-faucet, and long-lived-chain issues.
4. Only after that, run the VPS or staging gate for systemd and ingress-specific behavior.

## Genesis Runbook

Use `scripts/generate-genesis.sh` instead of hand-building a `genesis.json` file.

### Step 1: prepare wallet artifacts

Example for testnet:

```bash
./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network testnet \
  --prepare-wallet \
  --output-dir ./artifacts/testnet
```

This writes the wallet artifacts used for the next step, including `genesis-wallet.json`.

### Step 2: create the genesis DB

Example for local validator 1:

```bash
./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network testnet \
  --db-path ./data/state-7001 \
  --wallet-file ./artifacts/testnet/genesis-wallet.json \
  --validator-keypair ./data/state-7001/validator-keypair.json
```

Equivalent mainnet example:

```bash
./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network mainnet \
  --db-path ./data/state-8001 \
  --wallet-file ./artifacts/mainnet/genesis-wallet.json \
  --validator-keypair ./data/state-8001/validator-keypair.json
```

Important rules:

- local state directories are keyed by P2P port, not by network name
- VPS systemd state directories are keyed by network name
- use `--validator-keypair` or explicit `--initial-validator` inputs; the wrapper rejects the legacy handwritten flow

## Contract deployment and post-genesis bootstrap

Genesis auto-deploys the canonical contract catalog. LICN is native and is not part of that deployed contract set.

After a supported local or VPS genesis node is healthy, the canonical post-genesis bootstrap step is `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh`.

Run it manually against a healthy validator when needed:

```bash
./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 --skip-build
```

Use `http://127.0.0.1:9899` for mainnet, or set `DEPLOY_NETWORK=mainnet` explicitly when bootstrapping against a mainnet RPC.

Use it without `--skip-build` if WASM artifacts are missing:

```bash
./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

What it does:

- waits for validator health
- rebuilds `deploy-manifest.json` from the live genesis-deployed symbol registry
- keeps local helper key material aligned with the genesis admin key
- generates a signed metadata manifest when Node.js and the release-signing key are present

For VPSes, run `scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh` after genesis creation to copy the genesis admin and faucet keypairs into the system paths expected by custody and faucet before you start those services.

Outputs to verify:

- `deploy-manifest.json`
- signed metadata manifest file
- healthy DEX pair list from `/api/v1/pairs`

Operational notes:

- On VPSes, run `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` from the operator-owned repo checkout, not from the `lichen` service account, unless the repo path is traversable by that account.
- The script now refuses to trust a stale `deploy-manifest.json` unless it matches the live symbol registry. Older copies of the repo can still carry stale manifests, so a clean-slate redeploy should treat that file as disposable.
- If the script generates the signed metadata file in the repo checkout, install it into `/etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-<net>.json` before relying on public browser flows.

Local convenience wrapper:

```bash
make deploy-local
```

## VPS Runbook

### Step 1: stage the repo correctly

Do not use `git archive` for VPS staging in this repo. Ignored directories in this tree still matter for deployment.

Use a full repo sync into `~/lichen` instead:

```bash
rsync -az --delete \
  --exclude '.git' \
  --exclude 'target' \
  --exclude 'compiler/target' \
  --exclude 'data' \
  --exclude 'logs' \
  --exclude 'node_modules' \
  --exclude 'dist' \
  ./ <host>:~/lichen/
```

For a clean-slate redeploy, also remove stale repo-generated artifacts on the host before first boot:

```bash
rm -f ~/lichen/deploy-manifest.json
rm -f ~/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json ~/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-mainnet.json
```

### Step 2: build release binaries on the host

If the host was updated via `rsync` hotfixes, force Cargo to see fresh source mtimes before rebuilding. `rsync -a` preserves timestamps, and stale remote artifact mtimes can otherwise cause `cargo build` to reuse old validator binaries even when the new Rust source is present.

From the staged repo:

```bash
find . \
  \( -path './target' -o -path './compiler/target' -o -path './node_modules' \) -prune -o \
  -type f \( -name '*.rs' -o -name 'Cargo.toml' -o -name 'Cargo.lock' \) -exec touch {} +
```

From the staged repo:

```bash
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
cargo build --release --bin lichen-validator --bin lichen-genesis --bin lichen-faucet --bin lichen-custody --bin lichen --bin zk-prove
./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh
```

Critical contract artifact invariant:

- Genesis replay reads the top-level tracked files `contracts/<name>/<name>.wasm`.
- `./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh` rewrites those top-level files.
- Never rebuild contracts on only the genesis host after staging the repo to joining validators. That changes deterministic program addresses and guarantees a genesis state-root mismatch.
- Choose one path per rollout and keep it consistent across every validator:
  - stage one identical prebuilt repo bundle to every host and do not rebuild contracts on any host, or
  - run `./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh` on every host before `deploy/setup.sh`.
- `deploy/setup.sh` now prints the installed top-level contract bundle hash. Verify that hash matches on every VPS before creating genesis or starting joining validators.

Example verification command:

```bash
command find /var/lib/lichen/contracts -maxdepth 2 -name '*.wasm' | sort | xargs shasum -a 256 | shasum -a 256
```

Why the explicit `cargo` env load matters:

- `ssh <host> 'cd ~/lichen && cargo build ...'` uses a non-login shell on many VPSes, and `cargo` will be missing from `PATH` unless you source `~/.cargo/env` yourself.

### Step 3: install services and env files

On each VPS:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/setup.sh testnet
```

Or for mainnet:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/setup.sh mainnet
```

This creates:

- system user `lichen`
- `/etc/lichen`
- `/var/lib/lichen`
- `/var/log/lichen`
- `/etc/lichen/env-testnet` or `/etc/lichen/env-mainnet`
- validator, custody, and faucet systemd units

Service names:

- `lichen-validator-testnet`
- `lichen-validator-mainnet`
- `lichen-custody`
- `lichen-custody-mainnet`
- `lichen-faucet` on testnet only

### Step 4: bootstrap the genesis VPS

Run these steps on the first validator only.

`deploy/setup.sh` auto-generates `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` in `/etc/lichen/env-<net>` and writes the same password into `/etc/lichen/custody-env[-mainnet]`. The validator, genesis builder, custody service, and threshold signer share the canonical encrypted keypair format, so the same password must be present anywhere those files are loaded.

To inspect or export your validator keypair at any time:

```bash
# Load the password
LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD=$(grep LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD /etc/lichen/env-testnet | cut -d= -f2-)
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD

# Show public key and EVM address
lichen identity export --keypair /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json

# Also reveal the private seed (handle with extreme care)
lichen identity export --keypair /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json --reveal-seed
```

1. Start the validator once so it generates `validator-keypair.json`.
2. Record `publicKeyBase58` from that file.
3. Stop the service and clear any temporary state.
4. Prepare wallet artifacts.
5. Create the genesis DB.
6. Start the validator again.

Concrete sequence for testnet:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
sudo install -D -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \
  /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json \
  /var/lib/lichen/validator-keypair-testnet.json
sudo python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('/var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json'))['publicKeyBase58'])"
sudo systemctl stop lichen-validator-testnet
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/.lichen
sudo install -d -m 750 -o lichen -g lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
sudo install -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \
  /var/lib/lichen/validator-keypair-testnet.json \
  /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json

sudo -u lichen HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_CONTRACTS_DIR=/var/lib/lichen/contracts \
  lichen-genesis --network testnet --prepare-wallet --output-dir /var/lib/lichen/genesis-keys-testnet

PRICE_JSON=$(curl -sf 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT","ETHUSDT","BNBUSDT"]')
export GENESIS_SOL_USD=$(echo "$PRICE_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(t['price']) for t in json.load(sys.stdin) if t['symbol']=='SOLUSDT']")
export GENESIS_ETH_USD=$(echo "$PRICE_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(t['price']) for t in json.load(sys.stdin) if t['symbol']=='ETHUSDT']")
export GENESIS_BNB_USD=$(echo "$PRICE_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(t['price']) for t in json.load(sys.stdin) if t['symbol']=='BNBUSDT']")

sudo -u lichen HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_CONTRACTS_DIR=/var/lib/lichen/contracts \
  GENESIS_SOL_USD=$GENESIS_SOL_USD GENESIS_ETH_USD=$GENESIS_ETH_USD GENESIS_BNB_USD=$GENESIS_BNB_USD \
  lichen-genesis --network testnet \
  --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet \
  --wallet-file /var/lib/lichen/genesis-keys-testnet/genesis-wallet.json \
  --initial-validator <VALIDATOR_PUBKEY>

sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
```

Preserve the generated `validator-keypair.json` across the state wipe. If you delete it and restart the service on a different keypair than the one baked into genesis, the node will come up at stake `0`, stay at slot `0`, and never produce the founding blocks.

If `api.binance.com` is blocked or returns `451` on the host, export `GENESIS_SOL_USD`, `GENESIS_ETH_USD`, and `GENESIS_BNB_USD` from a trusted fallback source before running `lichen-genesis`.

### Step 5: run post-genesis deploy on the genesis VPS (MANDATORY)

After the validator is healthy, run the post-genesis deploy from the repo checkout on the genesis host as the checkout owner. **This step is required** — without it, the signed metadata manifest is not generated and all frontend portals (DEX, wallet, explorer, etc.) will fail to resolve contract addresses.

```bash
cd ~/lichen
DEPLOY_NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 --skip-build
```

For mainnet, run:

```bash
cd ~/lichen
DEPLOY_NETWORK=mainnet ./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:9899 --skip-build
```

This is the cleanest way to refresh the deploy manifest, helper key alignment, and signed metadata manifest in the current repo state.

The helper key alignment step now copies the encrypted `genesis-primary-*.json` file with mode `600`. That repo-local helper represents the current wrapped-token operational minter key used by local bootstrap flows, not the long-lived governed admin authority.

If the configured `LICHEN_SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR_FILE` lives under `/etc/lichen/secrets/`, the checkout owner may not be able to read it directly. In that case, copy it to a temporary user-readable path and pass it explicitly:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/lichen/secrets/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
chmod 600 ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
cd ~/lichen
SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR=$HOME/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json \
  DEPLOY_NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 --skip-build
rm -f ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
```

If the script generated the signed metadata file under `~/lichen/`, install it into the RPC-configured path before continuing. **Do not skip this step — the DEX and all frontends depend on it:**

```bash
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen \
  ~/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json \
  /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

Verify the manifest is served correctly:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); p=json.loads(d['result']['envelope']['payload']); print(f'{len(p.get(\"symbol_registry\",[]))} symbols in manifest')"
```

If this does not return the expected symbol count (28 for genesis), check that the manifest file exists at the path configured by `LICHEN_SIGNED_METADATA_MANIFEST_FILE` in `/etc/lichen/env-<net>` and restart the validator.

### Step 6: join additional validators

On every joining VPS, verify the installed state seed file matches the staged release file:

```bash
cmp /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/seeds.json /etc/lichen/seeds.json
```

For mainnet, compare `/var/lib/lichen/state-mainnet/seeds.json` instead.

`deploy/setup.sh` installs the checked-in `seeds.json` to both `/etc/lichen/seeds.json` and `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/seeds.json`. Joining validators use that seed file directly; no bootstrap flags or env overrides are required.

Copy the signed metadata manifest from the genesis VPS to each joining VPS, so all nodes serve the same contract address data to frontends:

```bash
# From genesis VPS:
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json ubuntu@<JOINING_VPS>:~/
# On joining VPS:
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen \
  ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json \
  /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
rm ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

**CRITICAL: Distribute genesis-keys and genesis-wallet.json** so the joining VPS has the treasury keypair for airdrop/faucet functionality. Without this, RPC airdrop requests to the joining VPS will fail with "Treasury keypair not configured":

```bash
# From genesis VPS — copy genesis-wallet.json:
sudo cat /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json \
  | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@<JOINING_VPS> \
  "sudo bash -c 'mkdir -p /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys && cat > /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json && chown lichen:lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json && chmod 640 /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json'"

# From genesis VPS — copy all genesis-keys/:
for f in $(sudo ls /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/); do
  sudo cat /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f \
    | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@<JOINING_VPS> \
    "sudo bash -c 'cat > /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f && chown lichen:lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f && chmod 640 /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f'"
done
```

Or use the automated distribution:
```bash
export LICHEN_JOINING_VPSES="<JOINING_IP_1> <JOINING_IP_2>"
bash scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh testnet --no-restart
```

Then start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
```

### Step 7: custody and faucet

`deploy/setup.sh` creates the custody env files, but you still need to provision the secret material.

Run `scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh` after genesis creation so `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` is populated from the encrypted `genesis-primary-*.json` artifact with secure permissions. Despite the historical path name, this file is now the wrapped-token operational minter key used by custody for `mint()` flows; wrapped-token admin and contract ownership move to governance during genesis.

Provision before starting custody:

- `/etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt`
- `/etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt`

Or the mainnet equivalents.

Permission model for those files matters:

- `/etc/lichen/secrets` must be `root:lichen` with mode `750`.
- Seed files must be `root:lichen` with mode `640`.
- `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` must remain `lichen:lichen` with mode `600`.
- `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` must be present in `/etc/lichen/custody-env` or `/etc/lichen/custody-env-mainnet` before custody starts, because that service now loads the same canonical encrypted keypair JSON used by genesis and validator helpers.
- If you provision them as `root:root 600`, `lichen-custody` will fail with `Permission denied`.

Wrapped-token authority split after genesis:

- contract owner and wrapped-token admin live under the governance authority
- custody keeps the current wrapped-token minter key until governance executes `set_minter`
- wrapped-token attester rotation now runs through the oracle-committee approval lane via `set_attester`
- cold admin transfer remains on the governance root via `transfer_admin` and `accept_admin`

Then start the services:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-custody
sudo systemctl start lichen-faucet
```

For mainnet, start custody only:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-custody-mainnet
```

Mainnet uses `lichen-custody-mainnet` and has no faucet.

### Step 8: external ingress and browser smoke tests

Do not stop after internal `127.0.0.1` health checks. Validate the public path that browsers will actually use.

For public testnet:

```bash
curl -si -X OPTIONS https://testnet-rpc.lichen.network/ \
  -H 'Origin: https://dex.lichen.network' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type'

curl -s https://testnet-rpc.lichen.network/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'

curl -s https://testnet-rpc.lichen.network/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getIncidentStatus","params":[]}'

curl -s https://testnet-rpc.lichen.network/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}'
```

If production portals are expected to stay usable, run the same checks against `https://rpc.lichen.network` too. Production portals default to `mainnet`, so a dead mainnet origin will surface as frontend CORS, incident-status, signed-metadata, and missing-contract-address errors even while `testnet-rpc.lichen.network` is healthy.

### Step 9: day-2 operations

Useful commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl status lichen-validator-testnet
sudo journalctl -u lichen-validator-testnet -n 200 --no-pager
sudo systemctl status lichen-custody
sudo journalctl -u lichen-custody -n 200 --no-pager
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
```

Firewall minimums:

- HTTP ingress: `80/tcp`
- HTTPS ingress: `443/tcp`
- testnet P2P: `7001/tcp`
- mainnet P2P: `8001/tcp`

Expose RPC, WS, faucet, and custody only through the reverse proxy layout you actually operate. The supported repo-managed layout lives in `deploy/Caddyfile.common`, `deploy/Caddyfile.testnet`, `deploy/Caddyfile.testnet-us`, `deploy/Caddyfile.mainnet`, and `deploy/Caddyfile.mainnet-us`, uses internal TLS at the VPS edge for Cloudflare-origin traffic, and is installed by `deploy/setup.sh`.

### Step 10: backup, restore, and disaster recovery

Do not use `reset-blockchain.sh` on VPS hosts. That script is intentionally limited to local and developer reset flows and is not the supported production restore path.

The authoritative backup set for a VPS validator is:

- `/etc/lichen/env-<net>`
- `/etc/lichen/custody-env` on testnet or `/etc/lichen/custody-env-mainnet` on mainnet
- `/etc/lichen/secrets/`
- `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` (wrapped-token operational minter key)
- `/etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-<net>.json`
- `/etc/lichen/incident-status-<net>.json`
- `/etc/lichen/service-fleet-<net>.json`
- `/etc/lichen/key-hierarchy.md`
- `/etc/lichen/drill-register.md`
- `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>`
- `/var/lib/lichen/.lichen`
- `/var/lib/lichen/service-fleet-status-<net>.json`
- `/var/lib/lichen/custody-db` on testnet or `/var/lib/lichen/custody-db-mainnet` on mainnet
- testnet only: `/var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json` and `/var/lib/lichen/airdrops.json`

Identity-critical files live inside that set. In particular, do not lose `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/validator-keypair.json` or `/var/lib/lichen/.lichen/node_identity.json`, or the node will come back with a different validator or P2P identity.

`deploy/setup.sh` can recreate `/var/lib/lichen/contracts` and the checked-in systemd units from the correct repo release, but include them in the backup if you want a faster single-archive restore and an easier offline drill.

Create an offline snapshot with services stopped. Start from the repo release that is actually running on the host.

```bash
NET=testnet
STAMP=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
BACKUP_DIR=/var/backups/lichen/$NET-$STAMP
VALIDATOR_SERVICE=lichen-validator-$NET
CUSTODY_SERVICE=lichen-custody
CUSTODY_ENV=/etc/lichen/custody-env
CUSTODY_DB=/var/lib/lichen/custody-db
OPTIONAL_SERVICE=lichen-faucet
OPTIONAL_PATHS=(
  /var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json
  /var/lib/lichen/airdrops.json
)

if [ "$NET" = "mainnet" ]; then
  CUSTODY_SERVICE=lichen-custody-mainnet
  CUSTODY_ENV=/etc/lichen/custody-env-mainnet
  CUSTODY_DB=/var/lib/lichen/custody-db-mainnet
  OPTIONAL_SERVICE=
  OPTIONAL_PATHS=()
fi

sudo install -d -m 750 -o root -g root "$BACKUP_DIR"
if [ -n "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE" ]; then
  sudo systemctl stop "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE"
fi
sudo systemctl stop "$CUSTODY_SERVICE"
sudo systemctl stop "$VALIDATOR_SERVICE"

sudo tar --xattrs --acls --numeric-owner -cpf "$BACKUP_DIR/lichen-$NET.tar" \
  /etc/lichen/env-$NET \
  "$CUSTODY_ENV" \
  /etc/lichen/secrets \
  /etc/lichen/custody-treasury-$NET.json \
  /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-$NET.json \
  /etc/lichen/incident-status-$NET.json \
  /etc/lichen/service-fleet-$NET.json \
  /etc/lichen/key-hierarchy.md \
  /etc/lichen/drill-register.md \
  /var/lib/lichen/state-$NET \
  /var/lib/lichen/.lichen \
  /var/lib/lichen/service-fleet-status-$NET.json \
  "$CUSTODY_DB" \
  /var/lib/lichen/contracts \
  "${OPTIONAL_PATHS[@]}"

(cd "$BACKUP_DIR" && sha256sum "lichen-$NET.tar" > SHA256SUMS)

sudo systemctl start "$VALIDATOR_SERVICE"
sudo systemctl start "$CUSTODY_SERVICE"
if [ -n "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE" ]; then
  sudo systemctl start "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE"
fi
```

Record the archive path, `SHA256SUMS`, the repo revision used to create the backup, and the contract bundle hash from Step 2 in the deployed `/etc/lichen/drill-register.md` before moving the archive to offline storage.

Restore onto a clean or rebuilt VPS by re-establishing the supported filesystem layout first, then extracting the preserved state back in place. A restore is not a genesis rebuild. Do not wipe the recovered state and do not rerun `lichen-genesis` when you are restoring an existing validator.

```bash
NET=testnet
BACKUP_DIR=/var/backups/lichen/testnet-20260406T120000Z
VALIDATOR_SERVICE=lichen-validator-$NET
CUSTODY_SERVICE=lichen-custody
RPC_PORT=8899
OPTIONAL_SERVICE=lichen-faucet

if [ "$NET" = "mainnet" ]; then
  CUSTODY_SERVICE=lichen-custody-mainnet
  RPC_PORT=9899
  OPTIONAL_SERVICE=
fi

cd ~/lichen
sudo bash deploy/setup.sh "$NET"

if [ -n "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE" ]; then
  sudo systemctl stop "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE"
fi
sudo systemctl stop "$CUSTODY_SERVICE"
sudo systemctl stop "$VALIDATOR_SERVICE"

(cd "$BACKUP_DIR" && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS)
sudo tar --xattrs --acls --numeric-owner -xpf "$BACKUP_DIR/lichen-$NET.tar" -C /

sudo chown -R lichen:lichen /var/lib/lichen
sudo chown root:lichen /etc/lichen/secrets
sudo chmod 750 /etc/lichen/secrets
sudo find /etc/lichen/secrets -type f -exec chown root:lichen {} \;
sudo find /etc/lichen/secrets -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \;

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start "$VALIDATOR_SERVICE"
sudo systemctl start "$CUSTODY_SERVICE"
if [ -n "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE" ]; then
  sudo systemctl start "$OPTIONAL_SERVICE"
fi

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$RPC_PORT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$RPC_PORT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getIncidentStatus","params":[]}'

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$RPC_PORT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}'
```

If the restore archive did not include `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` or the faucet keypair, but `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/genesis-keys` was restored, repopulate those service-facing files before restarting custody or faucet:

```bash
cd ~/lichen
sudo bash scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh "$NET" --no-restart
```

After the node is healthy, run the same public smoke tests from Step 8 and update the deployed `/etc/lichen/drill-register.md` with the restore transcript, checksum verification, recovered file inventory, and owner signoff. The quarterly offline backup restore drill in `docs/deployment/ROTATION_AND_RESTORE_DRILLS.md` should use this exact sequence.

## Manual single-node debugging

Use `lichen-start.sh` only when you need a manual, foreground, or one-off debugging flow instead of the supported local launcher or VPS systemd path.

Examples:

```bash
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='set-a-long-random-secret-before-first-start'
./lichen-start.sh testnet --foreground
mkdir -p ./data/state-mainnet
cp ./seeds.json ./data/state-mainnet/seeds.json
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='set-a-long-random-secret-before-first-start'
./lichen-start.sh mainnet
```

Notes:

- `--custody` is restricted to explicit local development
- this script is useful for manual debugging, but not the canonical steady-state service model

## Release signing and signed metadata

### Generate an offline release signing key

```bash
./scripts/generate-release-keys.sh ./offline-release
```

This prints the trusted signer address. Embed that address in `validator/src/updater.rs` before relying on signed release verification.

Keep the generated keypair offline.

### Sign a release artifact set

```bash
sha256sum <files...> > SHA256SUMS
./scripts/sign-release.sh SHA256SUMS ./offline-release/release-signing-keypair.json
```

This writes `SHA256SUMS.sig` next to `SHA256SUMS`.

### Generate a signed metadata manifest

Local example:

```bash
export SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR=/secure/local-signing/release-signing-keypair.json

node scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js \
  --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 \
  --network local-testnet \
  --keypair "$SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR" \
  --out ./signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

VPS example:

```bash
node scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js \
  --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 \
  --network testnet \
  --keypair /secure/offline-mounted/release-signing-keypair.json \
  --out /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

The local 3-validator launcher generates this manifest automatically.

On VPS deploys, `first-boot-deploy.sh` must now regenerate the manifest, install it into the configured `/etc/lichen/` target, and verify that the validator serves the expected DEX-related symbol registry entries back through `getSignedMetadataManifest`. If Node.js, the release-signing keypair, or the install step is missing, the deploy fails instead of continuing half-configured.

`first-boot-deploy.sh` no longer assumes a repo-local signing key. Set `LICHEN_SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR_FILE` in `/etc/lichen/env-<net>` via `deploy/setup.sh`, or export `SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR` explicitly for local-only workflows.

## ZK proof generation

Build the proof CLI:

```bash
cargo build --release -p lichen-cli --bin zk-prove
```

Generate proofs:

```bash
./target/release/zk-prove shield --amount 1000000000
./target/release/zk-prove unshield --amount 1000000000 --merkle-root <hex> --recipient <hex> --blinding <hex> --serial <hex>
./target/release/zk-prove transfer --transfer-json ./transfer-witness.json
```

The proof CLI writes JSON to stdout. That JSON is the input for the transaction-building side of the shielded flow.

Verifier note:

- Lichen uses transparent STARK proofs
- there is no separate trusted setup ceremony to ship to operators
- the verifier lives in the validator runtime; operators do not manually distribute a static trusted verifier key bundle as part of the normal deployment path

## Frontend and portal deployment

Static portals deploy through Cloudflare Pages. Current project names use the `lichen-network-` prefix.

Important behavior:

- In production, the portals default to `mainnet` until the user selects another network.
- A successful testnet rollout only makes the portals work if either the user switches to `testnet` or `rpc.lichen.network` is also healthy.

| Portal | Project name | Directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| website | `lichen-network-website` | `website/` |
| explorer | `lichen-network-explorer` | `explorer/` |
| wallet | `lichen-network-wallet` | `wallet/` |
| dex | `lichen-network-dex` | `dex/` |
| marketplace | `lichen-network-marketplace` | `marketplace/` |
| programs | `lichen-network-programs` | `programs/` |
| developers | `lichen-network-developers` | `developers/` |
| monitoring | `lichen-network-monitoring` | `monitoring/` |
| faucet | `lichen-network-faucet` | `faucet/` |

Supported repo deploy command:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-cloudflare-pages.sh <portal>
```

The wrapper runs the frontend asset audit, stages the selected portal into a clean temp directory, verifies required staged assets such as the DEX TradingView bundle, and then calls Wrangler from that staged `--cwd`.

Raw CLI pattern for reference only:

```bash
npx wrangler pages deploy <dir> --project-name lichen-network-<portal> --commit-dirty=true
```

Do not use the raw command as the normal repo workflow. It can silently omit git-ignored runtime assets that the staged deploy wrapper preserves.

`faucet-service` is the VPS/API backend. The browser faucet portal in `faucet/` is a separate Cloudflare Pages project: `lichen-network-faucet`.

## Final operator checklist

Before you call a deployment complete, verify all of the following:

- validator health returns `ok`
- expected contracts are present
- signed metadata manifest exists and is current
- local or VPS DEX pair list is populated
- custody and faucet health endpoints respond if those services are enabled
- external CORS preflight and JSON-RPC checks succeed for every public RPC hostname you expect browsers to use
- `getIncidentStatus` and `getSignedMetadataManifest` succeed through the public edge, not just on `127.0.0.1`
- release artifacts are signed if you are cutting an upgrade
- `zk-prove` builds and runs if you are validating privacy flows

Useful checks:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899/api/v1/pairs | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9105/health | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9100/health | python3 -m json.tool
ls -l deploy-manifest.json signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

If this document and the scripts ever disagree, trust the scripts first and then update this runbook immediately.

## Oracle price feed configuration

The oracle price feeder is **built into the validator binary** — there is no separate oracle service or market-maker process. Every running `lichen-validator` instance spawns `spawn_oracle_price_feeder()` which:

1. Opens a WebSocket to Binance for real-time aggregate trades (`solusdt`, `ethusdt`, `bnbusdt`).
2. Falls back to REST polling (`/api/v3/ticker/price`) every 5 seconds if the WS connection drops.
3. Stores prices in shared atomics (`SharedOraclePrices`).
4. Submits oracle-attestation transactions (system opcode 30) into the mempool every 5 seconds.
5. Broadcasts WS ticker and candle events to connected DEX frontend clients.

### Env vars

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LICHEN_ORACLE_WS_URL` | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/solusdt@aggTrade/ethusdt@aggTrade/bnbusdt@aggTrade` | Binance WebSocket stream |
| `LICHEN_ORACLE_REST_URL` | `https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT","ETHUSDT","BNBUSDT"]` | Binance REST fallback |
| `LICHEN_DISABLE_ORACLE` | unset | Set to `1` to disable the oracle entirely |

### US VPS geo-block

`api.binance.com` and `stream.binance.com` return HTTP 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons) from US IP addresses. If the validator is hosted on a US VPS, you **must** override both URLs to use Binance US:

```
LICHEN_ORACLE_WS_URL=wss://stream.binance.us:9443/ws/solusdt@aggTrade/ethusdt@aggTrade/bnbusdt@aggTrade
LICHEN_ORACLE_REST_URL=https://api.binance.us/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT","ETHUSDT","BNBUSDT"]
```

`deploy/setup.sh` auto-detects OVH US hosts (IP prefix `15.204.*`) and writes these overrides automatically. For other US hosting providers, manually uncomment or add the env vars in `/etc/lichen/env-<net>`.

### Diagnosing silent oracle failures

If the DEX shows static prices that never move:

1. Check validator logs for Binance connection errors:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u lichen-validator-testnet --no-pager | grep -i 'oracle\|binance\|price' | tail -20
   ```
2. Test the REST endpoint from the VPS:
   ```bash
   curl -sf 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT"]' || echo "BLOCKED"
   curl -sf 'https://api.binance.us/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT"]' || echo "BLOCKED"
   ```
3. Verify env vars are loaded:
   ```bash
   grep ORACLE /etc/lichen/env-testnet
   ```

### Genesis price seeding

The genesis builder reads `GENESIS_SOL_USD`, `GENESIS_ETH_USD`, and `GENESIS_BNB_USD` env vars to seed initial oracle prices into the genesis state. If `api.binance.com` is blocked on the genesis host, fetch the prices from a trusted fallback before running `lichen-genesis`:

```bash
# From a non-US machine or your local dev box:
curl -s 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT","ETHUSDT","BNBUSDT"]'
# Then export on the genesis host:
export GENESIS_SOL_USD=170.50
export GENESIS_ETH_USD=2650.00
export GENESIS_BNB_USD=620.00
```

---

## Release signing key management (critical)

### The canonical signing key

The repo ships `keypairs/release-signing-key.json` — this is the **only** signing keypair whose public key (`8HitBNnh8qbhfne5NCv2yHrQFoD6xbmHcWaUSgCGtsk`) is hardcoded in every frontend portal's `shared/utils.js` as `LICHEN_SIGNED_METADATA_SIGNERS`.

### The fatal mistake: generating keys on VPS

**NEVER run `scripts/generate-release-keys.sh` on a VPS.** That script creates a brand-new keypair with a different public key. If you use the VPS-generated key to sign metadata, every frontend portal will reject the manifest because the signer doesn't match the hardcoded expected signer.

### Correct signing key deployment

Copy the repo key to each VPS:

```bash
# From your local repo checkout:
scp -P 2222 keypairs/release-signing-key.json ubuntu@<VPS_IP>:~/release-signing-key.json

# On the VPS:
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen \
  ~/release-signing-key.json \
  /etc/lichen/secrets/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
rm ~/release-signing-key.json
```

If the US VPS has SFTP disabled:

```bash
cat keypairs/release-signing-key.json | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 'cat > ~/release-signing-key.json'
ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 'sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/release-signing-key.json /etc/lichen/secrets/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json && rm ~/release-signing-key.json'
```

### Verification

After deploying, verify the signed metadata manifest uses the expected signer:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}' \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
d = json.load(sys.stdin)
env = d['result']['envelope']
print(f\"Signer: {env['signer']}\")
assert env['signer'] == '8HitBNnh8qbhfne5NCv2yHrQFoD6xbmHcWaUSgCGtsk', 'WRONG SIGNER KEY'
p = json.loads(env['payload'])
print(f\"Symbols: {len(p.get('symbol_registry', []))}\")"
```

## Secrets distribution for joining validators

When joining EU and SEA validators to an existing genesis, these files must be copied from the genesis VPS:

| File | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `custody-master-seed-testnet.txt` | Genesis VPS `/etc/lichen/secrets/` | Custody HD wallet root |
| `custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt` | Genesis VPS `/etc/lichen/secrets/` | Custody deposit address derivation |
| `release-signing-keypair-testnet.json` | Repo `keypairs/release-signing-key.json` | Signed metadata manifest signing |
| `signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json` | Genesis VPS `/etc/lichen/` | Pre-generated signed manifest |
| `genesis-wallet.json` | Genesis VPS `/var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/` | Treasury keypair path mapping (needed for airdrop/faucet) |
| `genesis-keys/*` | Genesis VPS `/var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/` | Treasury keypair(s) — **required for RPC airdrop on all nodes** |

Copy procedure (genesis VPS → joining VPS):

```bash
# From genesis VPS:
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt ubuntu@<JOINING_IP>:~/
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt ubuntu@<JOINING_IP>:~/
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json ubuntu@<JOINING_IP>:~/

# On joining VPS:
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt /etc/lichen/secrets/
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt /etc/lichen/secrets/
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json /etc/lichen/
rm ~/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt ~/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

**Genesis-keys distribution** (genesis VPS → joining VPS):

```bash
# From genesis VPS — copy genesis-wallet.json + genesis-keys/:

## Complete clean-slate VPS redeployment checklist

This is the full step-by-step procedure for stopping everything, flushing all state, and redeploying from scratch so VPSes match the local 3-validator setup exactly.

### One-command automated redeploy (recommended)

```bash
bash scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh testnet    # or: mainnet
```

This is the canonical way to redeploy. It performs ALL phases automatically in ~3 minutes:

| Phase | What it does | Typical time |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. Stop | Stops all services on all 3 VPSes, opens UFW port for cross-VPS RPC | ~9s |
| 2. Flush | Removes all state, custody DB, manifests | ~7s |
| 3. Sync + Build | Rsyncs code to all VPSes, builds binaries + WASM contracts on genesis VPS, distributes WASM to joiners | ~37s |
| 4. Genesis | Generates validator keypair, prepares wallet, fetches live prices, creates genesis block, starts genesis validator | ~14s |
| 5. Post-genesis | Runs `vps-post-genesis.sh`, installs signing key, deploys 28 contracts via `first-boot-deploy.sh`, provisions custody seeds | ~13s |
| 6. State snapshot | Stops genesis validator briefly, snapshots full RocksDB state + all secrets into tarball, distributes to joining VPSes, restarts genesis | ~37s |
| 7. Start joiners | Generates keypairs on joining VPSes, starts validators, waits for sync (instant from state snapshot), starts custody + faucet | ~16s |
| 8. Verify | Checks health/slot/treasury/manifest on all 3 nodes + Cloudflare endpoint | ~37s |

Key design decisions:
- **State snapshot distribution**: Genesis state reconstruction is non-deterministic (different Merkle roots each time). The script snapshots the actual RocksDB state from the genesis VPS and distributes it to joiners, ensuring identical state roots.
- **WASM distribution**: WASM contracts are built only on the genesis VPS and distributed via tarball — not compiled independently on each VPS.
- **Atomic secrets**: All secrets (treasury, genesis-keys, custody seeds, manifest, signing key) are bundled into a single tarball per joining VPS — no partial copies.
- **SSH retry**: All SSH operations retry 3 times with exponential backoff (3s, 6s, 12s).
- **Code delivery**: Uses `rsync` (not `git pull`) since VPSes don't have `.git`.

Prerequisites:
- SSH access to all 3 VPSes (port 2222, user `ubuntu`, key-based auth)
- `deploy/setup.sh` already run on all VPSes (systemd units, users, dirs exist)
- `keypairs/release-signing-key.json` present in repo
- Code committed and pushed to main

### Manual phase-by-phase procedure (for debugging)

If the automated script fails or you need to debug, follow these phases manually:

### Prerequisites

- Latest code committed and pushed
- All CI checks green
- SSH access to all 3 VPSes (port 2222, user `ubuntu`)
- `keypairs/release-signing-key.json` present in repo
- `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` known (or will be auto-generated by setup.sh)

### Phase 1: Stop everything (all 3 VPSes)

```bash
for VPS in 15.204.229.189 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Stopping $VPS ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    sudo systemctl stop lichen-faucet 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo systemctl stop lichen-custody 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo systemctl stop lichen-validator-testnet 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "Services stopped"
  '
done
```

### Phase 2: Flush state (all 3 VPSes)

```bash
for VPS in 15.204.229.189 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Flushing $VPS ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/.lichen
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/custody-db
    sudo rm -f /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
    sudo rm -f /var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json
    sudo rm -f /var/lib/lichen/airdrops.json
    echo "State flushed"
  '
done
```

### Phase 3: Rsync code to all VPSes

```bash
for VPS in 15.204.229.189 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Syncing to $VPS ==="
  rsync -az --delete \
    --exclude '.git' \
    --exclude 'target' \
    --exclude 'compiler/target' \
    --exclude 'data' \
    --exclude 'logs' \
    --exclude 'node_modules' \
    --exclude 'dist' \
    -e 'ssh -p 2222' \
    ./ ubuntu@$VPS:~/lichen/
done
```

### Phase 4: Build on all VPSes

```bash
for VPS in 15.204.229.189 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Building on $VPS ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    cd ~/lichen
    source ~/.cargo/env
    # Touch source files so cargo sees them as newer than stale remote artifacts
    find . \( -path ./target -o -path ./compiler/target -o -path ./node_modules \) -prune -o \
      -type f \( -name "*.rs" -o -name "Cargo.toml" -o -name "Cargo.lock" \) -exec touch {} +
    cargo build --release --bin lichen-validator --bin lichen-genesis --bin lichen-faucet --bin lichen-custody --bin lichen --bin zk-prove
    ./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh
    echo "Build complete"
  '
done
```

### Phase 5: Run setup.sh on all VPSes

```bash
for VPS in 15.204.229.189 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Setup on $VPS ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    cd ~/lichen
    sudo bash deploy/setup.sh testnet
  '
done
```

This auto-detects the US VPS and configures Binance US oracle endpoints.

### Phase 6: Copy signing key to all VPSes

```bash
for VPS in 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  scp -P 2222 keypairs/release-signing-key.json ubuntu@$VPS:~/release-signing-key.json
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/release-signing-key.json /etc/lichen/secrets/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
    rm ~/release-signing-key.json
  '
done

# US VPS (SFTP may be disabled):
cat keypairs/release-signing-key.json | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 'cat > ~/release-signing-key.json'
ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 '
  sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/release-signing-key.json /etc/lichen/secrets/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
  rm ~/release-signing-key.json
'
```

### Phase 7: Genesis on US VPS (primary validator)

```bash
ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 '
  cd ~/lichen
  source ~/.cargo/env

  # Start once to generate validator keypair
  sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
  sleep 3
  VALIDATOR_PUBKEY=$(sudo python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open(\"/var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json\"))[\"publicKeyBase58\"])")
  echo "Validator pubkey: $VALIDATOR_PUBKEY"
  sudo systemctl stop lichen-validator-testnet

  # Preserve validator keypair, wipe state
  sudo install -D -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \

  sudo install -d -m 750 -o lichen -g lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
  sudo install -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \
    /var/lib/lichen/validator-keypair-testnet.json \
    /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json

  # Prepare wallet
  LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD=$(grep LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD /etc/lichen/env-testnet | cut -d= -f2-)
  export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD
  sudo -u lichen HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_CONTRACTS_DIR=/var/lib/lichen/contracts \
    LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD="$LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD" \
    lichen-genesis --network testnet --prepare-wallet --output-dir /var/lib/lichen/genesis-keys-testnet

  # Fetch genesis prices (use binance.us for US VPS)
  PRICE_JSON=$(curl -sf "https://api.binance.us/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=[\"SOLUSDT\",\"ETHUSDT\",\"BNBUSDT\"]")
  export GENESIS_SOL_USD=$(echo "$PRICE_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(t[\"price\"]) for t in json.load(sys.stdin) if t[\"symbol\"]==\"SOLUSDT\"]")
  export GENESIS_ETH_USD=$(echo "$PRICE_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(t[\"price\"]) for t in json.load(sys.stdin) if t[\"symbol\"]==\"ETHUSDT\"]")
  export GENESIS_BNB_USD=$(echo "$PRICE_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; [print(t[\"price\"]) for t in json.load(sys.stdin) if t[\"symbol\"]==\"BNBUSDT\"]")

  # Create genesis DB
  sudo -u lichen HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_CONTRACTS_DIR=/var/lib/lichen/contracts \
    LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD="$LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD" \
    GENESIS_SOL_USD=$GENESIS_SOL_USD GENESIS_ETH_USD=$GENESIS_ETH_USD GENESIS_BNB_USD=$GENESIS_BNB_USD \
    lichen-genesis --network testnet \
    --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet \
    --wallet-file /var/lib/lichen/genesis-keys-testnet/genesis-wallet.json \
    --initial-validator "$VALIDATOR_PUBKEY"

  # Start the genesis validator
  sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
  sleep 5
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"getHealth\",\"params\":[]}"
'
```

### Phase 8: Post-genesis on US VPS

```bash
ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 '
  cd ~/lichen

  # Run vps-post-genesis to copy keypairs to system paths
  sudo bash scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh testnet

  # Make the release signing key readable for first-boot-deploy
  sudo cp /etc/lichen/secrets/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
  sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json
  chmod 600 ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json

  # Run first-boot-deploy
  SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR=$HOME/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json \
    DEPLOY_NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 --skip-build

  rm -f ~/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json

  # Install the signed metadata manifest
  sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen \
    ~/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json \
    /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json

  # Restart validator to pick up manifest
  sudo systemctl restart lichen-validator-testnet
  sleep 3

  # Verify
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"getSignedMetadataManifest\",\"params\":[]}" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); e=d[\"result\"][\"envelope\"]; p=json.loads(e[\"payload\"]); print(f\"Signer: {e[\"signer\"]}, Symbols: {len(p.get(\"symbol_registry\",[]))}\")"

  # Provision custody seeds
  sudo bash -c "openssl rand -hex 32 > /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt"
  sudo bash -c "openssl rand -hex 32 > /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt"
  sudo chown root:lichen /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-*-seed-testnet.txt
  sudo chmod 640 /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-*-seed-testnet.txt

  # Start custody and faucet
  sudo systemctl start lichen-custody
  sudo systemctl start lichen-faucet
'
```

### Phase 9: Distribute secrets to joining VPSes

Joining validators sync the blockchain from the genesis seed node via P2P — **do NOT copy state**.
Each joining validator starts with an empty `state-testnet/` directory and catches up by
requesting blocks from the seed node(s) listed in `seeds.json`. This is the production-correct
flow because future agent-operated validators will join the same way.

Only secrets and the signed metadata manifest need to be distributed:

```bash
for VPS in 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Distributing secrets to $VPS ==="

  # Ensure the state directory exists but is empty (validator creates its own keypair on first start)
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
    sudo chown -R lichen:lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
  '

  # Copy custody secrets
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo cat /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt" \
    | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS "sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt && chown root:lichen /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt && chmod 640 /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt'"

  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo cat /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt" \
    | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS "sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt && chown root:lichen /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt && chmod 640 /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt'"

  # Copy signed metadata manifest
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo cat /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json" \
    | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS "sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json && chown root:lichen /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json && chmod 640 /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json'"

  # Copy custody treasury keypair
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo cat /etc/lichen/custody-treasury-testnet.json" \
    | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS "sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/lichen/custody-treasury-testnet.json && chown lichen:lichen /etc/lichen/custody-treasury-testnet.json && chmod 600 /etc/lichen/custody-treasury-testnet.json'"

  # Copy faucet keypair
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo cat /var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json" \
    | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS "sudo bash -c 'cat > /var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json && chown lichen:lichen /var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json && chmod 600 /var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json'"

  # CRITICAL: Copy genesis-wallet.json and genesis-keys/ (treasury keypair)
  # Without these, RPC airdrop requests to this node will fail with
  # "Treasury keypair not configured"
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo cat /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json" \
    | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS "sudo bash -c 'cat > /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json && chown lichen:lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json && chmod 640 /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-wallet.json'"

  for f in $(ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo ls /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/"); do
    ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 "sudo cat /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f" \
      | ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS "sudo bash -c 'mkdir -p /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys && cat > /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f && chown lichen:lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f && chmod 640 /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/genesis-keys/$f'"
  done

  echo "Done: $VPS"
done
```

### Phase 10: Start joining VPSes

```bash
for VPS in 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Starting $VPS ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
    sleep 5
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"getHealth\",\"params\":[]}"
    echo ""
    sudo systemctl start lichen-custody
    sudo systemctl start lichen-faucet
    echo "Services started"
  '
done
```

### Phase 11: Verify everything

```bash
for VPS in 15.204.229.189 37.59.97.61 15.235.142.253; do
  echo "=== Verifying $VPS ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$VPS '
    echo "--- Health ---"
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    echo ""
  '
  echo ""
done
```

Also verify external endpoints:

```bash
for HOST in testnet-rpc.lichen.network; do
  echo "=== External: $HOST ==="
  curl -s "https://$HOST/" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
  echo ""
  curl -s "https://$HOST/" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}' \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); e=d['result']['envelope']; print(f\"Signer: {e['signer']}\")" 2>/dev/null || echo "MANIFEST MISSING"
  echo ""
done
```

## Deployment postmortem: known pitfalls

This section documents actual deployment failures and their root causes, so they are never repeated.

### Pitfall 1: Release signing key mismatch

**Symptom**: DEX shows "Missing contract addresses", all frontends fail to load token metadata.

**Root cause**: `scripts/generate-release-keys.sh` was run on the VPS, creating a new keypair. The VPS signed the metadata manifest with a different key than what frontends expect.

**Fix**: Always copy `keypairs/release-signing-key.json` from the repo to `/etc/lichen/secrets/release-signing-keypair-testnet.json`. Never generate new keys on VPS.

**Prevention**: `deploy/setup.sh` does not generate signing keys. The operator must provision the canonical key manually.

### Pitfall 2: US VPS oracle geo-block

**Symptom**: DEX prices are static — they load from genesis but never update. Local 3-validator cluster works fine.

**Root cause**: The US VPS at `15.204.229.189` cannot reach `api.binance.com` / `stream.binance.com` (HTTP 451 geo-block). The validator's oracle feeder silently fails, no attestation transactions are submitted, and prices never move.

**Fix**: Set `LICHEN_ORACLE_WS_URL` and `LICHEN_ORACLE_REST_URL` to binance.us endpoints in `/etc/lichen/env-testnet`.

**Prevention**: `deploy/setup.sh` now auto-detects US hosts and writes binance.us overrides.

### Pitfall 3: Stale deploy-manifest.json

**Symptom**: `first-boot-deploy.sh` fails or generates incorrect signed metadata.

**Root cause**: An old `deploy-manifest.json` from a previous deployment was carried into the new rsync. The script detects a mismatch with the live symbol registry.

**Fix**: Delete `deploy-manifest.json` and `signed-metadata-manifest-*.json` from the repo checkout on the VPS before running `first-boot-deploy.sh`.

### Pitfall 4: Cargo not in PATH on VPS

**Symptom**: `cargo build` fails with "command not found" over SSH.

**Root cause**: SSH non-login shells don't source `~/.cargo/env`. Running `ssh host 'cargo build'` fails.

**Fix**: Always prefix with `source ~/.cargo/env` in SSH commands.

### Pitfall 5: SFTP disabled on US VPS

**Symptom**: `scp` fails to the US VPS.

**Root cause**: OVH US VPS has SFTP subsystem disabled in sshd_config.

**Fix**: Use `cat file | ssh host 'cat > remote_file'` for file transfers to US VPS.

### Pitfall 6: Custody permission denied

**Symptom**: `lichen-custody` fails to start with "Permission denied" on seed files.

**Root cause**: Seed files provisioned as `root:root 600` instead of `root:lichen 640`.

**Fix**: Ensure `/etc/lichen/secrets` is `root:lichen 750` and all files inside are `root:lichen 640`.

### Pitfall 7: Missing LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD in custody env

**Symptom**: Custody service can't read the encrypted treasury keypair.

**Root cause**: `deploy/setup.sh` writes the password to both `env-testnet` and `custody-env`, but if setup.sh is re-run without preserving the original password, the custody env gets a new password that doesn't match the encrypted keypair.

**Fix**: Setup.sh preserves existing passwords. If you need to change the password, you must re-encrypt all keypair files.

### Pitfall 8: Contract WASM binary mismatch across validators

**Symptom**: Joining validators fail to sync — state root mismatch at genesis block.

**Root cause**: Contracts were rebuilt only on the genesis VPS, producing different WASM hashes than the joining VPSes.

**Fix**: Either (a) rsync pre-built WASM artifacts to all VPSes and never rebuild, or (b) run `./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh` on ALL VPSes before genesis. Verify the bundle hash matches:

```bash
command find /var/lib/lichen/contracts -maxdepth 2 -name '*.wasm' | sort | xargs shasum -a 256 | shasum -a 256
```

### Pitfall 9: TOFU identity prevents rejoining after state wipe

**Symptom**: Wiped validator responds on RPC but stays at slot 0. P2P connections from other validators close immediately: `Failed to accept stream: closed by peer: 0`.

**Root cause**: The wiped validator generates a new keypair and P2P identity. Other validators have the old identity cached in their TOFU (Trust On First Use) store at `data/state-<port>/home/.lichen/peer_identities.json`. The TOFU check rejects the new identity as an impostor.

Also, the wiped validator's new pubkey registers as a separate entry in the validator set. With N+1 validators and only N-1 online (original minus the ghost), BFT quorum (2/3+) may be unreachable.

**Fix for local dev**: Remove the wiped validator's entry from all other validators' TOFU stores, then restart all validators from scratch:

```bash
# Remove stale TOFU entries (example: V2 on port 7002 was wiped)
python3 -c "
import json
for v in ['state-7001', 'state-7003']:
    path = f'data/{v}/home/.lichen/peer_identities.json'
    with open(path) as f:
        d = json.load(f)
    if '127.0.0.1:7002' in d:
        del d['127.0.0.1:7002']
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(d, f, indent=2)
```

**Prevention**: If you must wipe a single validator, preserve its `validator-keypair.json` and `home/.lichen/node_identity.json` first and restore them after the wipe. Or wipe all validators and create a fresh genesis.

---

## Nuclear reset procedure

Use this when the validators have diverged beyond recovery (e.g. state root mismatch, stuck consensus, validator identity conflicts).

### Local nuclear reset

```bash
# 1. Stop everything
./lichen-stop.sh all
# Kill any lingering supervisors
pkill -9 -f validator-supervisor

### VPS nuclear reset (all validators)

```bash
# 1. Stop services on ALL VPSes
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03; do
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network \
    'sudo systemctl stop lichen-validator-testnet lichen-custody lichen-faucet'
done

# 2. Wipe state on ALL VPSes (preserve keypairs!)
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03; do
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network '
    sudo cp /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json /tmp/vk-backup.json
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/.lichen
    sudo install -d -m 750 -o lichen -g lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
    sudo install -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen /tmp/vk-backup.json \
      /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json
    sudo rm /tmp/vk-backup.json
  '
done

# 3. Recreate genesis on the primary (US) VPS — follow Step 4 from VPS Runbook above

# 4. Run post-genesis deploy on the genesis VPS — follow Step 5

# 5. Copy signed metadata manifest to joining VPSes — follow Step 6

# 6. Start validators on ALL VPSes
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03; do
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network \
    'sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet'
done

# 7. Start custody and faucet on genesis VPS
ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@seed-01.lichen.network \
  'sudo systemctl start lichen-custody && sudo systemctl start lichen-faucet'

# 8. Verify all 3 are healthy
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03; do
  echo "=== $HOST ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network \
    'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"getHealth\",\"params\":[]}"'
  echo ""
done
```

Critical: always preserve `validator-keypair.json` during a nuclear reset. If you lose it, the genesis validator pubkey changes and a completely new genesis is required.

## Cloudflare Pages deployment

All frontend portals are deployed as static sites to Cloudflare Pages via Wrangler.

### Projects

| Portal | Pages project | Directory | Custom domain |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| DEX | `lichen-network-dex` | `dex/` | `dex.lichen.network` |
| Wallet | `lichen-network-wallet` | `wallet/` | `wallet.lichen.network` |
| Explorer | `lichen-network-explorer` | `explorer/` | `explorer.lichen.network` |
| Faucet | `lichen-network-faucet` | `faucet/` | `faucet.lichen.network` |
| Marketplace | `lichen-network-marketplace` | `marketplace/` | `marketplace.lichen.network` |
| Developers | `lichen-network-developers` | `developers/` | `developers.lichen.network` |
| Programs | `lichen-network-programs` | `programs/` | `programs.lichen.network` |
| Monitoring | `lichen-network-monitoring` | `monitoring/` | `monitoring.lichen.network` |
| Website | `lichen-network-website` | `website/` | `lichen.network` |

### Deploy all frontends

```bash
for portal in dex wallet explorer faucet marketplace developers programs monitoring website; do
  echo "=== Deploying $portal ==="
  wrangler pages deploy "$portal/" \
    --project-name "lichen-network-$portal" \
    --branch main \
    --commit-dirty=true
  echo ""
done
```

### Deploy a single frontend

```bash
wrangler pages deploy dex/ --project-name lichen-network-dex --branch main --commit-dirty=true
```

### Shared configuration

All portals share `shared-config.js` which defines RPC endpoints, WebSocket URLs, and cross-portal links. When updating this file:

1. Edit the canonical copy in `dex/shared-config.js`
2. Copy to all other portals:

```bash
for dir in wallet explorer faucet marketplace developers programs monitoring website; do
  cp dex/shared-config.js "$dir/shared-config.js"
done
```

3. Verify all copies are identical:

```bash
shasum dex/shared-config.js wallet/shared-config.js explorer/shared-config.js \
  faucet/shared-config.js marketplace/shared-config.js developers/shared-config.js \
  programs/shared-config.js monitoring/shared-config.js website/shared-config.js
```

4. Redeploy all portals via the deploy loop above.

### Custom domains

Custom domains are managed in the Cloudflare Dashboard, not via Wrangler:

1. Go to Pages > project > Custom domains
2. Add the domain (e.g. `dex.lichen.network`)
3. Cloudflare auto-creates a CNAME record if DNS is managed by Cloudflare

### Faucet architecture

The faucet has two separate components served on different domains:

- **`lichen-network-faucet.pages.dev`** (Cloudflare Pages): Static faucet portal (HTML/JS/CSS). This is the user-facing page.
- **`faucet.lichen.network`** (Cloudflare → Caddy → VPS port 9100): Faucet Rust/axum API service. This is the backend that dispenses LICN.

The static portal calls the API at `https://faucet.lichen.network/faucet/request`. This works because:

1. `shared-config.js` sets `faucet: 'https://faucet.lichen.network'` in production
2. `faucet.js` reads `LICHEN_CONFIG.faucet` as `FAUCET_API`
3. DNS for `faucet.lichen.network` routes through Cloudflare to the US VPS
4. Caddy (`Caddyfile.testnet-us`) reverse proxies all traffic to `127.0.0.1:9100`
5. The faucet-service CORS layer allows `https://faucet.lichen.network` and all portal origins

The faucet service only serves API endpoints (`/health`, `/faucet/config`, `/faucet/status`, `/faucet/airdrops`, `/faucet/request`). It does NOT serve static HTML — that comes from Cloudflare Pages.

Do NOT confuse the `faucet` key in `shared-config.js` with a portal URL — it is the API endpoint. The faucet portal is accessed via the Pages `.pages.dev` domain or a custom domain added to the Pages project.

## Incident Log

### 2026-04-09: Treasury keypair missing on seed-02/seed-03

**Symptom:** RPC `requestAirdrop` calls routed via Cloudflare round-robin intermittently failed with `"Treasury keypair not configured"`. DEX and marketplace tests on VPS showed 0 orders/trades because wallets only had ~20 LICN (genesis allocation) and could not fund contract operations.

**Root cause:** The `genesis-wallet.json` and `genesis-keys/` directory (containing the treasury keypair) are local artifacts created ONLY on the genesis VPS during genesis creation. They are NOT part of the blockchain state that syncs via P2P. The deployment pipeline had no step to distribute these files to joining VPSes. Seed-02 and seed-03 had empty `genesis-keys/` directories and no `genesis-wallet.json`, causing `load_treasury_keypair()` to return `None`.

**Fix:** Added genesis-keys distribution to all deployment paths:
- `run-validator.sh`: Auto-propagates genesis-keys from V1 to V2/V3 in local dev
- `scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh`: New section 6 distributes genesis-keys to joining VPSes
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`: Updated Step 6, secrets table, and Phase 9 of clean-slate checklist
- `deploy/setup.sh`: Added Step 5a with explicit genesis-keys distribution commands
- `skills/validator/setup-and-run-validator.sh`: Auto-copies genesis-keys for joining validators
- `skills/validator/SKILL.md`: Added genesis-keys setup instructions for external validators

**Prevention:** Every joining validator — whether VPS, local dev, or external agent — must have `genesis-wallet.json` and `genesis-keys/` copied from the genesis node before starting. The deployment scripts now enforce this automatically.

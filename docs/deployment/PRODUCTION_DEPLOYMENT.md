# Lichen Deployment Runbook

This is the current operator runbook for the repo as it exists today.

Use this document as the canonical workflow for:

- local validator development via `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh`
- local production-parity stack validation via `scripts/start-local-stack.sh`
- VPS validator deployment from verified signed-release artifacts via
  `scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh`
- local full-stack extension when custody, faucet, and browser flows are needed
- genesis DB creation and post-genesis bootstrap
- signed release and signed metadata generation
- local ZK proof generation

This runbook intentionally prefers the scripts that are verified in the current tree over older narrative docs.

Resolve the release and restart-safe rollback from the latest dated, sealed
deployment evidence for the selected network. A source version or historical
runbook example is not proof of the installed release or completed acceptance.
Never deploy from a dirty or partially staged worktree. Require the exact tag
workflow, attestations, checksums, detached PQ signature and four-validator
Archive V2 gate before installation. Preserve all recorded signed artifact
sets through live parity and rollback rehearsal; cleanup needs evidence checks.
The [September 10 v0.5.291 deployment record](V0.5.291_TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT_2026-09-09.md)
records the published signed release and completed catalog-462 adoption on all
four existing Testnet validators. Preserve signed v0.5.290 and the older recorded
rollback artifact sets, including v0.5.280, v0.5.281 and v0.5.265. Retaining an
artifact does not establish that it can restart the current state and catalog;
verify compatibility and the recorded recovery procedure before rollback. Neither
`v0.5.229` nor any pre-schema-3 anchor can be used after required legacy rows
are retired.

Use [Archive V2 deployment preflight](ARCHIVE_V2_DEPLOYMENT_PREFLIGHT.md) for
actual-input bounds, exact-client gateway TLS, checkpoint capacity, cache
warming, coordinated recovery and runtime-load acceptance. Pin each host's
actual native snapshot inventory rather than assuming checkpoint metadata or
an IDENTITY file is included in a RocksDB-only snapshot.

Transaction metrics are a mandatory deployment acceptance check on devnet,
testnet and mainnet. After current finality is established, run
`python3 tests/live-transaction-metrics.py --rpc-url <validator-rpc>` for each
validator and the explorer's RPC origin. Repeat after own-state restart and
Archive V2 role activation. The read-only check requires actual transactions;
an idle window is unproven. It compares total, UTC daily and block counter
deltas with complete canonical block bodies. Local four-validator acceptance
submits three transfers from its generated distribution wallet after sampling,
so external oracle feed timing cannot hide the regression.

For a historical counter repair, use the signed release containing
`lichen-archive-v2 metrics-reconcile` and follow the
[canonical metrics audit](../audits/V0.5.284_CANONICAL_METRICS_2026-09-07.md).
Verify the chosen release's tag workflow and detached PQ signature. The existing
Testnet correction has already completed; do not replay it as part of ordinary
release or catalog maintenance. For a separately justified repair, the sequence is:

1. Preserve prior durable counters and qualify an immutable canonical source.
   Run bounded `profile-source` ranges, link their predecessor/last hashes and
   verify transaction Merkle roots, counts and UTC days. Independently validate
   the historical prefix baseline and every suffix range. A checksum identifies
   evidence; it does not establish that its claims are correct. Missing history
   cannot be counted as zero. Existing Testnet waiver treatment does not apply
   to a fresh network or mainnet.
2. Bind the repair plan to the source manifest SHA-256, exact current tip/hash,
   prior total transaction/block counters, reconstructed totals and UTC date.
   `total_blocks` is the canonical tip slot plus one, including genesis. If the
   fixed source stops before the maintenance tip, verify and include the complete
   suffix before preparing the plan. Include any transactions already counted by
   the fixed release exactly once.
3. Qualify the exact command, source inputs, resource bounds and failure cases
   on the target Linux platform. Stop the validator cleanly under the coordinated
   deployment plan, preserve its current own WAL and identity, and prove no
   validator or maintenance writer holds the database. Do not reuse an old stop
   record. On that stopped database run the signed utility with
   `metrics-reconcile --state-dir <existing-state> --plan <plan.json>` plus
   `--plan-sha256 <sha256> --source-manifest <manifest.json>` and
   `--acknowledge-stopped-validator`. Keep the source manifest and plan with the
   operation evidence. The command acquires the exclusive database lock and
   aborts on changed counters, frontier or date.
4. Verify the synchronous correction record and counters, then restart the same
   signed validator from its own state/WAL. An exact repeated plan is a no-op;
   changed plans sharing the same evidence identifier abort. Verify all four
   validators' counters against the reconstructed source, observe live total
   and daily advancement, and repeat after restart and through the explorer
   origin. Record backfill acceptance separately from Archive V2 retirement.

Deployment preflight must compare each actual producer and consumer's bounds,
not defaults inferred from a previous operation. Pin immutable input identities,
sample current free space separately, and verify effective service configuration
and the installed/running artifact hashes. R2 cleanup requires an enumerated
obsolete-object list checked against current catalogs, recovery sources,
rollback artifacts and retention requirements before deletion.

Mainnet launch must use the gated checklist in [MAINNET_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md](MAINNET_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md). That runbook is the owner-facing package for launching the 4-validator mainnet first, then enabling custody only after post-genesis verification and route-specific dust tests pass.

Mandatory state/sync policy: [TESTNET_STATE_AND_SYNC_POLICY.md](TESTNET_STATE_AND_SYNC_POLICY.md). For any shared testnet, staging, or mainnet-like network, do not reset state and do not distribute a copied validator state directory unless the network owner explicitly approves that exact reset. Joining validators must sync from their own state directories.

Archive V2 architecture and the approved 2026-07-21 storage bridge:
[ARCHIVE_V2_SEGMENTED_STORAGE_PLAN_2026-07-21.md](ARCHIVE_V2_SEGMENTED_STORAGE_PLAN_2026-07-21.md).
This is the canonical implementation plan for immutable compressed segments,
transparent historical reads, validator archive roles, migration, replication,
capacity policy, and the temporary testnet-only 5 GiB / 50,000-slot response.
The exact live-fleet completion and cadence plan is
[ARCHIVE_V2_ACTIVATION_CADENCE_AND_VALIDATOR_LIVENESS_PLAN_2026-08-18.md](ARCHIVE_V2_ACTIVATION_CADENCE_AND_VALIDATOR_LIVENESS_PLAN_2026-08-18.md).
It records the bounded four-validator equal-policy verified-cache transition,
stable tail-building procedure, dual-R2 publication order, storage
gates, and the separate future offline-validator consensus design.

Restriction schema activation policy: [RESTRICTION_SCHEMA_ACTIVATION.md](RESTRICTION_SCHEMA_ACTIVATION.md). RG-804 activation is testnet-only, uses `scripts/activate-restriction-schema-testnet.sh`, requires explicit owner approval for that exact activation, stops validators only long enough to set the shipped state-root schema flag, and records per-host sync evidence. It is not a reset path and must not copy chain state.

## Supported operator paths

| Workflow | Supported entrypoint |
| --- | --- |
| **VPS rolling signed-release update** | Non-destructive default for code-only upgrades: `LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh testnet` |
| **VPS coordinated signed-release update** | Required for consensus/storage-critical upgrades: `LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z LICHEN_COORDINATED_RELEASE=1 scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh testnet` |
| **VPS clean-slate redeploy** | Owner-approved only: `LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z LICHEN_OWNER_APPROVED_RESET='owner-approved:testnet:15.204.229.189,37.59.97.61,15.235.142.253,148.113.43.247' LICHEN_CLEAN_SLATE_REDEPLOY_CONFIRM='clean-slate:testnet:15.204.229.189,37.59.97.61,15.235.142.253,148.113.43.247' scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh testnet` |
| **Testnet restriction schema activation** | Owner-approved only: `LICHEN_OWNER_APPROVED_RESTRICTION_SCHEMA_ACTIVATION='owner-approved:restriction-schema:testnet:15.204.229.189,37.59.97.61,15.235.142.253,148.113.43.247' LICHEN_RESTRICTION_SCHEMA_ACTIVATION_CONFIRM='activate-restriction-schema:testnet:15.204.229.189,37.59.97.61,15.235.142.253,148.113.43.247' scripts/activate-restriction-schema-testnet.sh` |
| Local validator development | `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh` |
| **Local production-parity stack** | `scripts/start-local-stack.sh testnet` |
| VPS initial provisioning | Exact signed-release unit/env/Caddy templates plus approved host-local secret provisioning |

Approved host-local provisioning installs the checked-in Caddy fragments from
the exact signed release, enables `caddy`, and keeps raw RPC, WebSocket, faucet,
custody, and Moss ports off the public firewall surface. On testnet, the
host-specific origin name and root-owned token file
append an authenticated public-CA origin used only by the four-origin
Cloudflare Worker. Do not store that token in a systemd environment file.

## Deployment path selection

Choose the least destructive path that matches the evidence:

| Situation | Required path | State policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code-only validator, RPC, P2P, indexing, or performance fix | `LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh <testnet|mainnet>` | Do not reset or copy state. Install the signed release and restart one validator at a time. |
| Stalled BFT height after evidence capture, with a verified liveness fix that does not change genesis or state format | Coordinated signed-release recovery: install the signed release on every validator, stop all validator services, then start all validators from their preserved local state | Do not flush state, do not copy RocksDB, do not delete WAL, do not regenerate validator keys, and do not use clean-slate unless owner-approved evidence proves state is unrecoverable. |
| One node is stale because of local disk/log pressure, bad service state, or a host rebuild | Fix disk/log pressure first, then rejoin only that node from its own preserved validator identity | Do not wipe the whole network. Do not copy RocksDB state from another validator. Delete that node's local `state-<net>` only when the operator explicitly approves that single-node rejoin. |
| Genesis contents must change, launch rehearsal must start from block 0, or every node has provably inconsistent chain state | Owner-approved `LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh <testnet|mainnet>` | Destructive. Stop services, preserve and verify each validator keypair, install the signed release archive, flush chain state, create genesis on the seed, then start joiners from empty chain state so they sync from peers. |
| Contract metadata, custody, faucet, Moss, Caddy, firewall, or secret ownership issue while the chain is healthy | Fix only the affected service from the exact signed templates and approved host-local secret provisioning | Do not touch validator state. |

Analytics v2 in `v0.5.224` is not a code-only rolling update. It changes the
deterministic post-block state projection and must use a coordinated
all-validator stop/install/start after archive and `dex_trade_*` history parity
is proven. On first post-upgrade block, every validator independently rebuilds
analytics from its own canonical history and commits the schema marker plus
bridge cursor atomically. A missing trade or referenced block is a hard blocker,
not permission to reset, copy another validator DB, or skip migration.

Rolling-release rules:

- A rolling release must use a published or draft GitHub Release with `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` attached.
- A validator release, including an emergency recovery release, is blocked until the mandatory local deployment drill below passes from the release binary. Do not skip it because the change looks small, docs-only, or "obviously safe"; if the deployed artifact changes, the drill runs first.
- For the public 4-validator testnet, the local gate must include a 4-validator
  topology drill when the change touches consensus, startup, sync, WAL recovery,
  archive/cold-store behavior, release install/restart behavior, or exchange
  readiness. The 3-validator drill is the minimum; it is not enough by itself
  for public-fleet restart resilience.
- The deployment evidence must include a stop/restart/rejoin matrix: stop one
  non-seed validator and prove finality continues, restart that validator from
  its own state, then repeat for the seed or the public-fleet equivalent. For
  consensus/startup changes, also stop all local validators from a healthy tip,
  restart them from preserved state, and prove they resume BFT without flushing
  state, copying RocksDB, deleting WAL, or regenerating identities.
- Sync and checkpoint-repair changes must also pause one LiveSync validator
  process while the remaining quorum advances across a material gap. Resume the
  same process and prove it catches up within the configured drift bound, then
  stop the fleet and prove its hot/cold public-history manifest still matches
  every peer. Process liveness or incoming future blocks are not catch-up proof.
- Before a VPS deploy, capture every host's active release hash, `getHealth`,
  `getMetrics`, validator identity, archive flags, and active
  `state-<network>/genesis.json` consensus timing. Mixed active timing
  descriptors are an incident finding and must be included in the release
  analysis; they cannot be ignored because the chain is currently producing.
- `scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh` performs the VPS disk/log preflight,
  refuses non-live state backup directories under `/var/lib/lichen`, installs
  release binaries and `seeds.json`, proves installed/running hashes for the
  validator, Archive V2 utility, custody, faucet, and Moss provider, waits for
  local health, then checks the public RPC edge. Default mode restarts one
  validator at a time. `LICHEN_COORDINATED_RELEASE=1` stops and stages every
  host before it starts any new validator and is mandatory for
  consensus/storage-critical releases.
- Rolling release is the default for cadence, WebSocket, RPC indexing, and consensus performance fixes because those fixes do not require a new genesis.
- Any release that changes replay, block import, post-block effects, fees, staking, oracle, or validator-set handling must include deterministic-state coverage for local-observer differences, including commit-certificate subsets.
- Any release that changes genesis bootstrap, public-history indexes, archive/cold
  storage, snapshot export/import, or validator sync must run the four-validator
  hot+cold public-history gate before VPS rollout:
  `LICHEN_RUN_LAUNCHPAD_E2E=1 LICHEN_RUN_VOLUME_E2E=1 LICHEN_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_COLD=1 LICHEN_COLD_RETENTION_SLOTS=20 LICHEN_COLD_MIGRATION_INTERVAL_SECS=5 bash tests/local-multi-validator-test.sh 4`.
  The gate must finish with identical public-history manifest roots across all
  four local validators.
- Any release that changes fee charging or block commit batching must prove the public `getTotalBurned` value increases after a finalized fee-bearing transaction or drill. Do not accept explorer fee display alone as proof; it can be derived from the transaction while the consensus burned counter remains stale.
- For an existing chain, Neo route/rewards/proof/agent code ships as a normal signed rolling release first. Do not set `LICHEN_GENESIS_NEO_GAS_REWARDS_ENABLE=1`, do not inject fresh-genesis Neo env, and do not activate Neo post-genesis payloads until every validator is running the new release and health/WS/DEX smokes pass.
- If a rolling release exposes a state-root mismatch, split tip, or stalled BFT
  height, preserve every validator's state/logs, identify the last certified
  common boundary, fix and tag the code, and recover each database through
  deterministic replay or authenticated checkpoint repair. A clean slate is
  allowed only when the owner separately changes chain identity or evidence
  proves the complete network state unrecoverable. Do not copy RocksDB state
  between validators to "heal" the split.
- A full reset is not a code-deploy mechanism. Use it only when the chain identity or genesis state must intentionally change, or after captured evidence proves the whole network state is unrecoverable.

Coordinated signed-release recovery rules for a stalled live height:

- Use this only after evidence capture proves services and state are present but BFT liveness is stalled. It is not a replacement for normal rolling deploys.
- The release must pass the mandatory local drill below with the same validator count as the public fleet, including one-validator stop/restart, seed stop/restart, and all-validator same-tip restart from preserved state.
- Capture and save each VPS `getHealth`, `getMetrics`, active release hash, validator pubkey, systemd PID/start timestamp, archive flags, and recent consensus logs before touching services.
- Download the GitHub Release archives, verify `SHA256SUMS`, attach and verify `SHA256SUMS.sig`, and verify the expected binary hashes before any service stop.
- Prestage or install the exact signed release binaries on all validators while preserving `/var/lib/lichen/state-<network>`, `/var/lib/lichen/archive-<network>`, `/etc/lichen`, validator keypairs, node identity, peer cache, and consensus WAL.
- Stop all validator services only after every host has the signed release staged. Start all validator services from preserved state, then verify every running process hash matches the release hash and no process is executing a deleted binary.
- For a release with an unset consensus-v1 activation marker, prove every
  stopped database has the same tip and tip hash. Let `ACTIVATION_SLOT` be
  exactly that common tip plus one. Run this command first without `--execute`
  on all hosts; every output must report the same `last_slot`,
  `expected_activation_slot`, and `activation_ready=true`. Then run the execute
  form with the exact confirmation
  on every host before starting any validator:

  ```bash
  sudo -u lichen /usr/local/bin/lichen-validator \
    --network testnet \
    --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet \
    --prepare-consensus-v1-activation \
    --activation-slot "$ACTIVATION_SLOT"

  sudo -u lichen /usr/local/bin/lichen-validator \
    --network testnet \
    --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet \
    --prepare-consensus-v1-activation \
    --activation-slot "$ACTIVATION_SLOT" \
    --execute \
    --confirm "consensus-v1-activation:testnet:$ACTIVATION_SLOT"
  ```

  A mismatched tip, requested slot, existing marker, binary hash, or dry-run
  result blocks the whole start. Do not prepare a lagging node and do not start
  any candidate process until all databases have the same durable boundary.
  This boundary activates crash-complete post-block effects, analytics v2, and
  strict chain-ID transaction signatures together. Blocks below it retain the
  bounded `v0.5.223` chain-domain-then-legacy transition policy; blocks at or
  above it have no legacy verification fallback.
- The recovery is green only when every validator reports the same release, public RPC returns healthy fresh blocks, block height advances for a sustained window, `getMetrics` is available, WebSocket slot subscriptions advance, and explorer-facing endpoints display current data.

For the v0.5.274 preserved-chain Testnet DEX repair, use the single coordinated
release entrypoint only after the exact signed release has passed every gate:

```bash
LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=v0.5.274 \
LICHEN_COORDINATED_RELEASE=1 \
LICHEN_REPAIR_TESTNET_DEX_CONTRACTS=1 \
bash scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh testnet
```

The deployer verifies the signed archive, stages every validator and leaves it
stopped, installs the archive's paired WASM/ABI bundle under the immutable
release directory, and only then runs the guarded repair on each independent
database. The repair dry-runs first, requires the v0.5.274 confirmation, and
must dry-run afterward with `contracts=17` and `changed=0` before any validator
starts. It preserves each contract address, owner, balance, storage, prior code
hash, and version history. Missing ABIs, an active validator, a non-Testnet
network, a non-coordinated rollout, a mismatched immutable bundle, or any
partial repair leaves the complete fleet stopped. Never substitute locally
built WASMs, rebuild on a VPS, copy another validator's state, or reset chain
history.

## Mandatory Local Deployment Drill

Every validator deployment must pass this drill before any VPS validator is
rolled, restarted for release, or declared exchange-ready. The minimum local
cluster is three validators. Use four validators when the target public fleet is
four validators or when the change touches consensus, sync, snapshots, archive
storage, startup recovery, release install, custody/faucet sequencing, or public
exchange readiness.

This gate is required for normal releases and emergency recovery releases:

1. Build the exact release binaries that will be installed on VPSes.
2. Start a fresh local production-parity stack with archive mode and cold
   history enabled through `scripts/start-local-stack.sh testnet` or the
   documented four-validator equivalent.
3. Verify all validators produce blocks, finalize, serve `getHealth`,
   `getFeeConfig`, `getBlock`, `getTransaction`, `getTransactionsByAddress`,
   and WebSocket slot subscriptions.
4. Force hot-to-cold archive migration or otherwise prove old block and
   transaction history are served through the cold-store path, then restart the
   affected validator and verify the same archive queries still pass.
5. Stop one non-seed validator, wait for the remaining validators to continue
   finalizing, restart it from its own state directory, and prove it catches up
   without a state copy.
6. Stop the seed validator, wait for the remaining validators to continue
   finalizing or record the documented quorum behavior, restart it from its own
   state directory, and prove it catches up without a state copy.
7. Run a same-tip stale-cluster restart drill: stop all local validators after a
   healthy run, restart all from preserved state, and prove they observe peer
   tips, exit any pre-consensus gate, and resume finality.
8. Run a snapshot/checkpoint recovery drill with cold-migrated archive rows:
   trigger or simulate an interrupted live snapshot apply, restart the affected
   validator, and prove rollback recovery restores state without requiring hot
   block-history rows.
9. Run the exchange simulation end to end: create a deposit wallet, send LICN,
   detect deposit, credit an internal account, withdraw, poll finality, and
   reconcile balances and transaction history.
10. Run the public-readiness checks against the local stack shape first, then
    rerun against public testnet only after the VPS rollout is complete.
11. Save command transcripts, local validator logs, restart PIDs/timestamps,
    archive query outputs, and cleanup output under an ignored evidence
    directory before approving the VPS deployment.

Failure of any item blocks deployment. Do not replace a failed drill with a
manual live restart, RocksDB copy, marker deletion, or reset. Fix the code or
runbook, rerun the full drill from clean local state, then continue.

Restart/rejoin invariant:

- Stopping a validator, restarting a validator, or restarting it after a release
  must preserve its state directory, cold archive directory, validator keypair,
  node identity, known peer evidence, service secrets, and release evidence.
- A resumed validator must rejoin from its own durable state. It must not
  regenerate identity, wipe RocksDB, delete archive history, or import another
  validator's state unless the operator is intentionally executing the
  owner-approved clean-slate runbook.
- Startup recovery may repair an interrupted local operation only from positive
  local evidence. If the node has a non-zero tip, a stored genesis block, a slot
  cursor, or an attached cold archive that backs historical blocks, recovery must
  preserve that chain progress and clear stale bootstrap markers instead of
  treating the node as a fresh joiner.
- Post-block repair must be bounded by the release's durable activation slot.
  Fresh chains initialize slot 1. Existing public validators must first be
  stopped at one exact tip/hash, then each independent database must dry-run and
  execute the guarded prepare command for the same `common tip + 1`. It
  WAL-syncs and reads back the marker. Startup without it exits 78 instead of
  choosing a local height. Missing markers before that slot are never replay
  evidence; activated repair requires the exact canonical block and fails
  closed on a body gap. Offline execute refuses a database with no activation
  boundary. Never create, backdate, remove, or infer this marker to force a
  repair.
- Hot/cold archive split is a storage optimization only. Hot data may serve
  recent reads faster and cold data may serve old history, but together they are
  the validator's local archive. Any release touching this path must prove old
  `getBlock`, `getTransaction`, and account-history reads survive hot-to-cold
  migration, process restart, validator stop/rejoin, and rollback-marker
  recovery.

## TLS termination model

Production RPC and WebSocket listeners do not terminate TLS inside the Rust services.
The supported production shape is:

- Cloudflare or another trusted edge in front of the node
- Caddy on the origin host terminating HTTPS and WSS with the checked-in `deploy/Caddyfile.*` configs
- local origin proxying from Caddy to the raw app listeners on `127.0.0.1`
- firewall rules that keep raw RPC and WS ports off the public internet

Primary public endpoints are:

- mainnet: JSON-RPC `https://rpc.lichen.network`, WebSocket `wss://rpc.lichen.network/ws`
- testnet: JSON-RPC `https://testnet-api.lichen.network`, WebSocket `wss://testnet-api.lichen.network/ws`
- explorer same-origin testnet gateway: JSON-RPC
  `https://explorer.lichen.network/api/testnet`, WebSocket
  `wss://explorer.lichen.network/api/testnet/ws`

The testnet public hostname is a Cloudflare Worker custom domain, not a DNS
record for one validator. `edge/testnet-rpc` probes and routes across four
independently authenticated Caddy origins in US, EU, SEA, and IN. Its strict
`/edge-health` endpoint returns HTTP 503 unless all four origins are healthy and
within 64 slots of the highest origin. Normal requests fail over on origin
health, network, and gateway failures. Each origin must use a distinct
`ORIGIN_AUTH_TOKEN_<REGION>` Wrangler secret and matching
`/etc/lichen/secrets/edge-origin-auth` value.

The mainnet node-local mapping also includes a dedicated WebSocket alias:

- mainnet: `rpc.lichen.network -> 127.0.0.1:9899`, `/ws -> 127.0.0.1:9900`, `ws.lichen.network -> 127.0.0.1:9900`

Operational rule: direct exposure of the raw RPC or WebSocket listeners is unsupported for production. If Caddy, unique origin authentication, strict edge health, or the firewall posture is missing, the node is not in a production-ready network shape even if the Rust services are running.
When the checked-in mainnet Caddy config uses `tls internal`, every advertised
HTTPS/WSS hostname must be proxied through the trusted edge. Do not publish a
DNS-only `A` record for `ws.lichen.network` unless Caddy is configured with a
public CA certificate and the public WSS smoke test passes. Testnet uses the
Worker custom domain for both HTTPS and WSS; it has no separate public WS alias.

## Supporting scripts

| Task | Supporting script |
| --- | --- |
| **Full automated VPS redeploy** | `LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh` |
| **Rolling signed-release VPS deploy** | `scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh` |
| Testnet restriction state-root schema activation | `scripts/activate-restriction-schema-testnet.sh` |
| Local full stack extension | `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` |
| Local full-stack stop/status | `scripts/stop-local-stack.sh`, `scripts/status-local-stack.sh` |
| Genesis wallet + DB creation | `scripts/generate-genesis.sh` |
| Post-genesis bootstrap | `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` |
| VPS post-genesis keypair copy | `scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh` |
| Manual single-node debugging | `lichen-start.sh` |
| Release signing | Offline maintainer procedure; the public repository contains only the trust anchor and verifier |
| Signed metadata manifest | `scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js` |
| Health check | `scripts/health-check.sh` |
| Cloudflare Pages deploy | `scripts/deploy-cloudflare-pages.sh` |
| ZK proof generation | `target/release/zk-prove` |

Important distinctions:

- `run-validator.sh` is a local-development helper behind the 3-validator launcher, not a supported operator entrypoint on its own.
- `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` extends the supported local validator path with custody, faucet, and post-genesis bootstrap.
- `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` is post-genesis bootstrap only. Genesis itself deploys the contract catalog.
- `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` is also the protocol-readiness gate: it fails unless `getLichenBridgeStats` reports a live quorum and `getLichenOracleStats` reports all launch feeds.
- `lichen-start.sh` is for manual foreground debugging only, not part of the supported operator runbook.

## Local parity contract

The repo supports two different local workflows, and they are not interchangeable:

- `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh` is for validator and consensus development. It is intentionally lighter than VPS deployment.
- `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` is the supported local analog for production-like stack validation.

If you are trying to answer "will this behave like the VPS deployment except for being disposable?", use `scripts/start-local-stack.sh`, not the validator-only launcher.

Production-parity rule:

- The acceptable difference between local parity runs and VPS runs is disposability and host orchestration.
- Local parity runs may use repo-local data paths, shell-managed processes, and loopback networking.
- Local parity runs must still use the same release binaries, the same genesis flow, the same post-genesis bootstrap, the same contract artifacts, the same signed-metadata generation path, the same custody/faucet services, and the same keypair-password policy.

Current status of that contract in this repo:

| Concern | Local 3-validator | Local full stack | VPS deployment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3-validator consensus shape | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Release validator binary | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Genesis + post-genesis bootstrap | Partial | Yes | Yes |
| Custody service | No | Yes | Yes |
| Faucet service | No | Yes on testnet | Yes on US testnet host |
| Signed metadata manifest refresh | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Same encrypted-keypair path when `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` is exported | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Public ingress via Caddy / Cloudflare | No | No | Yes |
| systemd ownership of services | No | No | Yes |
| Disposable reset to clean genesis | Yes | Yes | No by default |

Operational consequence:

- Do not treat `scripts/start-local-3validators.sh` as a production-representative environment.
- Treat `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` as the required local gate for production-like E2E and matrix work.
- Treat VPS or staging deployment as the final gate for systemd, ingress, firewall, and long-lived-state behavior.
- Treat shared testnet state as developer-owned live state. A reset requires explicit owner approval and developer communication.

Workflow parity rule:

- The parity model is seed-first, not "three equivalent local validators".
- Validator 1 or seed-01 creates genesis and owns the first post-genesis bootstrap.
- Validators 2, 3, and 4 are joiners against that already-created chain.
- Local parity work is only considered valid when it follows that same logical sequence before tests run.

Phase-by-phase equivalence:

| Phase | Local full stack | VPS clean-slate redeploy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reset state | Reset repo-local `data/state-*` paths before launch when a fresh chain is required | Stop services and wipe `/var/lib/lichen/*` before redeploy |
| Seed genesis | Validator 1 pre-generates all validator identities, creates or refreshes local genesis state, and embeds the full bridge/oracle operator set while only validator 1 is active at slot zero | `seed-01` pre-generates all four VPS validator identities, creates the new genesis state, and embeds the 4-key bridge/oracle operator set while only `seed-01` is active at slot zero |
| Post-genesis bootstrap | `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` waits for the genesis artifacts and then runs `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` on validator 1 | `scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh` runs `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` on `seed-01` after genesis |
| Joiners come online | Validators 2, 3, and 4 keep their own keypairs, start from empty chain state directories, verify the canonical genesis/network identifier, then obtain all post-genesis chain state through normal sync from peers | `seed-02`, `seed-03`, and `seed-04` keep their own keypairs, receive only service configuration/secrets for their own host, verify the canonical genesis/network identifier, and sync chain state from seed peers |
| Auxiliary services | Custody and faucet start from the genesis-derived local key material | Custody and faucet start from the seed host's provisioned key material |
| Validation gate | Run E2E and matrix workloads against the local stack, then rerun without reset | Run final staging or VPS verification for systemd, ingress, firewall, and long-lived state |

Current implementation note:

- The logical workflow is now the same: seed genesis, post-genesis bootstrap on the seed, then independently syncing joiners. Do not copy RocksDB state, block-0 RocksDB bundles from another validator, `genesis-wallet.json`, `genesis-keys/`, peer cache, validator identity, or consensus WAL to make a joiner work.
- The only acceptable shared genesis artifact is the canonical network genesis descriptor/hash, not a mutable database snapshot from one validator host.
- The remaining difference is host orchestration: local starts loopback processes with shell supervision, while VPS starts systemd services across hosts and distributes only service-level secrets.
- That infrastructure difference does not replace the VPS gate for service-orchestration, ingress, or long-lived-state behavior.

## Network selection and public ingress

- Local browser workflows default to `local-testnet`.
- Current pre-mainnet production portals default to `testnet` and call `https://testnet-api.lichen.network`, except the explorer, which uses its same-origin `/api/testnet` Worker route.
- Mainnet cutover must explicitly flip each portal `shared-config.js` `productionPrimaryNetwork`/visible-network policy to `mainnet` before Cloudflare Pages deployment.
- Public testnet RPC lives at `https://testnet-api.lichen.network`; it must never resolve or route to only one validator.
- A healthy testnet redeploy does not make mainnet-ready portal checks healthy if `rpc.lichen.network` or its Cloudflare/Caddy/origin path is down.
- Browser CORS, incident-status, signed-metadata, and symbol-registry errors on the portals can be caused by an ingress failure first. A Cloudflare `502` is surfaced by browsers as a CORS-style failure because the error page is not the RPC app.

## Prerequisites

Install these before running any of the workflows below:

- Rust toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Node.js for signed metadata manifest generation
- Python 3 with `venv` support for the repo Python tools
- `curl` and `python3`
- On VPSes, a Rust install that can be loaded in non-login shells via `. "$HOME/.cargo/env"`

Deployment helper note:

- `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` now bootstraps `.venv` from `sdk/python/requirements.txt` if the required Python modules are missing, but it still requires `python3 -m venv` to work.

Recommended setup from repo root:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || true
cargo build --release --bin lichen-validator --bin lichen-genesis --bin lichen-faucet --bin lichen-custody --bin lichen --bin zk-prove
./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh
```

If you want the repo-wide convenience build instead:

```bash
make build
```

## Paths and outputs

Know the path conventions before you start:

| Environment | Validator state |
| --- | --- |
| Local validator 1 | `data/state-7001` on testnet, `data/state-8001` on mainnet |
| Local validator 2 | `data/state-7002` on testnet, `data/state-8002` on mainnet |
| Local validator 3 | `data/state-7003` on testnet, `data/state-8003` on mainnet |
| VPS / systemd | `/var/lib/lichen/state-testnet` or `/var/lib/lichen/state-mainnet` |

Other important outputs:

- local signed metadata manifest: `signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json` or `signed-metadata-manifest-mainnet.json`
- local full-stack logs: `/tmp/lichen-local-testnet` or `/tmp/lichen-local-mainnet`
- deploy manifest: `deploy-manifest.json`
- VPS validator envs: `/etc/lichen/env-testnet` and `/etc/lichen/env-mainnet`
- VPS custody envs: `/etc/lichen/custody-env` and `/etc/lichen/custody-env-mainnet`

## VPS disk and log guardrails

The July 11, 2026 EU incident showed that EU's hot/cold layout no longer fit
safely on its 193 GiB root disk. EU reached 100%
while writing slot 8,912,000, RocksDB returned `No space left on device`, and
the nested binary/systemd supervisors attempted more than 2,600 restarts. EU
held about 106 GiB of hot state and 68 GiB of cold archive; its newest
checkpoint was mostly hard links and was not the root cause. The July 14 raw
audit later found 68.64 GB of old history stranded in hot storage because a
point-optimized iterator had stopped early. The bounded total-order migration
makes the current disk repairable in place. All public validators still need
equivalent genesis-to-tip data, so deleting EU history is not a capacity fix.

Operational rules:

- Do not keep copied RocksDB chain-state backups on `/` or under `/var/lib/lichen` after a reset. Keep only the live `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>` directory on each validator and move any required archive off-host or onto a separately monitored volume.
- Before a rolling release, audited launch rehearsal, or mainnet launch, every
  archive filesystem must pass measured headroom checks. Normal rollout
  requires at least 20 GiB free and less than 90% use by default. History repair
  first performs a complete dry run and requires free space equal to 150% of
  the missing key/value bytes plus a 10 GiB reserve. Environment overrides may
  raise these floors; they must never lower them below the operation's measured
  write/compaction peak.
- The approved host baseline installs persistent journald limits and, when sudo I/O logging already exists, compression and two-day tmpfiles retention for `/var/log/sudo-io`. Re-apply that audited baseline on old hosts before using them for a reset or launch.
- A node with `getHealth.result.disk.critical=true`, an HTTP 503 `stale_tip`, or an archive filesystem above the critical threshold is not eligible for Cloudflare/public RPC routing.
- Below 20 GiB free the validator skips new checkpoints. Below 10 GiB it exits with status 78; the checked-in systemd unit and built-in supervisor both refuse to restart that persistent safety failure.

Required preflight on every VPS, including rolling updates:

```bash
run_validator_admin() {
  local binary="$1"
  shift
  sudo -u lichen bash -lc \
    'ulimit -n 1048576 2>/dev/null || ulimit -n 65535; exec "$0" "$@"' \
    "$binary" "$@"
}

df -h /var/lib/lichen
sudo du -sh /var/lib/lichen /var/log/journal /var/log/sudo-io 2>/dev/null || true
sudo find /var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/checkpoints -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \
  -type d -name 'slot-*' -printf '%f\n' | sort -V
sudo find /var/lib/lichen -maxdepth 1 -type d \
  \( -name 'state-testnet-*' -o -name 'state-mainnet-*' -o -name '*backup*' \) -print
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<rpc-port> -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
```

Validators create legacy full-archive RocksDB checkpoints every 1,000 slots. Archive V2 hot-repair checkpoints physically compact public history to their advertised bounded window and therefore use a 10,000-slot cadence; this keeps fresh-join recovery practical without forcing a full bounded-history compaction every few minutes. An existing validator may publish this profile only after either a fresh Archive V2 sync or the stopped-validator `role-bootstrap` has proved exact catalog/state/WAL/identity/source parity and durably persisted its chain-and-role-bound state admission fingerprint. The role marker alone is insufficient. `LICHEN_CHECKPOINT_KEEP_COUNT` defaults to `2`; raise it only on hosts with enough disk headroom. `LICHEN_CHECKPOINT_MAX_BYTES` defaults to 8 GiB total logical checkpoint size, clamps at 128 GiB, and can be set to `0` only when an operator intentionally disables the size cap. Size pruning preserves the newest checkpoint even when one logical checkpoint exceeds the cap, so peers keep at least one snapshot source. Checkpoints are hard-linked to live RocksDB files, so `du` can attribute live DB bytes to `checkpoints/`; disk cleanup must remove only old `slot-*` checkpoint directories and never active state files. Hot-repair creation additionally reserves twice the measured public-history CF allocation for physical rebuild/compaction and skips safely when that headroom is unavailable. Legacy checkpoint creation remains fail-closed when filesystem capacity cannot be read or less than 20 GiB remains.

Sparse Merkle node and leaf column families are derived current-state caches.
They are rebuilt from canonical accounts and contract storage and are not a
substitute for historical blocks, transactions, or contract-state snapshots.
Do not delete their SST files or use filesystem cleanup to change them. If
RocksDB properties show node SST size materially exceeding the current
reachable tree, stop and boot-disable the validator, record slot/root/identity/
genesis/archive evidence and free space, then use the typed maintenance command:

```bash
run_validator_admin /usr/local/bin/lichen-validator \
  --network <net> \
  --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-<net> \
  --cache-size-mb 1024 \
  --rebuild-sparse-state-commitment

run_validator_admin /usr/local/bin/lichen-validator \
  --network <net> \
  --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-<net> \
  --cache-size-mb 1024 \
  --show-state-commitment-schema
```

The rebuild range-clears and compacts only derived sparse node/leaf caches,
then reconstructs both trees from canonical state. Require the show command to
verify computed and stored roots, and require slot, identity, genesis, and
archive evidence to remain unchanged before restart. Resume through the next
checkpoint boundary and verify normal retention removes the prior hard-linked
checkpoint and that sparse-node SST size remains bounded. Any root mismatch,
RocksDB error, or approach to the runtime floor is a stop condition.

If the backup `find` command returns non-live state backups, remove them only after confirming they are not the active `state-<net>` path and any required archive has been moved off-host. If `/var/log/sudo-io` or `/var/log/journal` is large, run `sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=512M` and `sudo systemd-tmpfiles --clean /etc/tmpfiles.d/sudo-io-retention.conf` after the approved host baseline has installed the retention files.

## Keypair password policy

Outside explicit local development, set `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` before the first validator, genesis, custody, or signer start and keep the same value available on every restart.

Operational rules:

- canonical validator, treasury, genesis-primary, faucet, and signer keypair JSON files are encrypted at rest when `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` is set
- production loaders refuse plaintext keypair files; only `LICHEN_LOCAL_DEV=1` permits plaintext in a disposable local environment
- the secure local E2E path should export `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` so the production code path is exercised before redeploy
- any helper copy of a keypair file must preserve owner-only permissions; use the checked-in scripts rather than ad hoc `cp`
- on testnet, every enabled `lichen-faucet.service` unit must load the same keypair password used to encrypt `FAUCET_KEYPAIR`; a healthy validator does not make the faucet healthy if this service secret is missing

## Local Runbook

### Local 3-validator cluster

Use this when you want the verified multi-validator path with signed metadata generation and nothing else.

This is not the production-parity local deployment. It is a validator-focused developer workflow.

Start from a clean state:

```bash
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='local-e2e-secret'
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh start-reset
```

Reuse an existing cluster without resetting state:

```bash
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh start
```

Check health:

```bash
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh status
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8901 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8903 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
```

Stop the cluster:

```bash
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh stop
```

What this launcher does:

- starts 3 validators through `run-validator.sh`
- creates local genesis state on validator 1 when needed
- writes validator state under `data/state-7001`, `data/state-7002`, `data/state-7003`
- generates a signed metadata manifest once the cluster is healthy

What it does not do:

- it does not start custody or faucet
- it does not manage local stack status outside validator health
- it does not mirror the VPS service layout closely enough for release-signoff E2E work

### Local full stack

Use this when you want the closest supported local analog to the VPS deployment while keeping the stack disposable.

This is the local production-parity path for E2E and matrix validation.

The required local interpretation is:

- validator 1 creates genesis
- validators 2 and 3 join that chain by importing verified block-0 state, then replaying later blocks
- custody and faucet come up against that chain
- `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` performs the same post-genesis bootstrap that the seed VPS performs before production-like tests run

Start:

```bash
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='local-e2e-secret'
./scripts/start-local-stack.sh testnet
```

By default this launcher resets the local validator state first so the stack comes up from fresh genesis. Set `LICHEN_LOCAL_RESET_CLUSTER=0` only when you intentionally want to reuse the existing local chain.

Status:

```bash
./scripts/status-local-stack.sh testnet
```

Stop:

```bash
./scripts/stop-local-stack.sh testnet
```

What the full-stack launcher does, in order:

- starts validator 1 and establishes genesis state
- waits for the genesis treasury and deployer key material to appear
- starts custody service
- starts faucet service on testnet
- runs `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` against validator 1
- starts validators 2 and 3 from empty chain state directories with their own validator keypairs
- validators 2 and 3 fetch the canonical genesis config from validator 1's RPC and sync/replay blocks from peers

What still differs from VPS deployment:

- processes are shell-managed rather than owned by systemd
- state lives under repo-local `data/state-*` paths rather than `/var/lib/lichen/*`
- ingress is loopback-only and does not include Caddy or Cloudflare
- SSH, firewall, service-user, and origin-edge behavior are not part of the local stack
- VPS also distributes custody/faucet/signing service secrets, while external validators receive none of those service secrets

What must not differ for production-like testing:

- release binaries and contract artifacts
- genesis and first-boot bootstrap behavior
- joiner validators must not receive copied RocksDB chain state
- custody/faucet/runtime feature set
- signed metadata generation path
- encrypted keypair handling when `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` is set

Where to look for logs:

```bash
ls /tmp/lichen-local-testnet
```

### Local verification checklist

After starting either local flow, verify the chain before moving on:

```bash
for port in 8899 8901 8903; do
  curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:${port}" -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}' | python3 -m json.tool
done
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9105/health | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899/api/v1/pairs | python3 -m json.tool
ls -l signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

If your local-private harness is present, you can additionally run the old validator smoke test, but treat it as destructive:

```bash
bash scripts/run-local-private-check.sh tests/local-multi-validator-test.sh -- \
  bash tests/local-multi-validator-test.sh
```

That legacy harness flushes `data/state-*` and boots its own validator sequence. Use it only as a standalone disposable validator smoke test, not as an in-place verifier for an already-running production-parity local stack.

Keep `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` exported while running Python or SDK-driven E2Es against that cluster. The helper files under `keypairs/` and `data/state-*/genesis-keys/` may now be encrypted canonical keypair JSON, and the SDK loader uses the same password to open them.

For production-like validation, the minimum local gate is:

1. Run `scripts/start-local-stack.sh testnet` from a clean reset.
2. Run `LICHEN_RUN_LAUNCHPAD_E2E=1 LICHEN_RUN_VOLUME_E2E=1 LICHEN_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_COLD=1 LICHEN_COLD_RETENTION_SLOTS=20 LICHEN_COLD_MIGRATION_INTERVAL_SECS=5 bash tests/local-multi-validator-test.sh 4` and preserve the evidence that a joiner restarts from its own state, keeps its validator keypair, does not reimport genesis, catches back up without copied RocksDB, WAL, genesis-wallet, or genesis-key artifacts, and matches the public-history manifest root across all local hot/cold stores after the complete user journeys.
3. Run the intended E2E or matrix workload, including faucet-backed native LICN funding when faucet behavior is part of the release.
4. Re-run the same workload without resetting state to catch reused-signer, reused-faucet, and long-lived-chain issues.
5. Stop one local validator, restart it from its existing state, and verify all validators continue producing and converge again before any live rollout.
6. Only after that, run the VPS or staging gate for systemd and ingress-specific behavior.

This gate is mandatory for every live deployment, including small exchange-readiness changes. A release that has not passed clean local multi-validator stop/restart/rejoin testing is not ready for public testnet deployment.

## Genesis Runbook

Use `scripts/generate-genesis.sh` instead of hand-building a `genesis.json` file.

### Step 1: prepare wallet artifacts

Example for testnet:

```bash
./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network testnet \
  --prepare-wallet \
  --output-dir ./artifacts/testnet
```

This writes the wallet artifacts used for the next step, including `genesis-wallet.json`.

### Step 2: create the genesis DB

Example for local validator 1:

```bash
./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network testnet \
  --db-path ./data/state-7001 \
  --wallet-file ./artifacts/testnet/genesis-wallet.json \
  --validator-keypair ./data/state-7001/validator-keypair.json
```

Equivalent mainnet example:

```bash
./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network mainnet \
  --db-path ./data/state-8001 \
  --wallet-file ./artifacts/mainnet/genesis-wallet.json \
  --validator-keypair ./data/state-8001/validator-keypair.json
```

Important rules:

- local state directories are keyed by P2P port, not by network name
- VPS systemd state directories are keyed by network name
- use `--validator-keypair` or explicit `--initial-validator` inputs; the wrapper rejects the legacy handwritten flow

### Neo public beta gate

Neo public beta activation is fail-closed. Do not set `LICHEN_GENESIS_NEO_GAS_REWARDS_ENABLE=1` on a VPS, staging host, or any public testnet/mainnet genesis unless the NX-900 manifest has already passed:

```bash
node scripts/qa/check_neo_public_beta_gate.js \
  --manifest /etc/lichen/neo-public-beta-gate-testnet.json
```

When `scripts/generate-genesis.sh` sees public Neo GAS rewards genesis activation outside `LICHEN_LOCAL_DEV=1`, it requires:

```bash
export LICHEN_NEO_PUBLIC_BETA_GATE_MANIFEST=/etc/lichen/neo-public-beta-gate-testnet.json
```

The manifest must include owner/governance/security/custody/legal/deployment approvals, numeric route and rewards caps, reward funding evidence, disclosure URL and hash, rollback/monitoring metadata, and local test evidence. For fresh genesis, the manifest's `activation.fresh_genesis_env` values must exactly match the `LICHEN_GENESIS_NEO_GAS_REWARDS_*` env values used by genesis. For a running chain, use `activation.mode=post_genesis_governance` with a governed proposal id, payload hash, and timelock instead of fresh-genesis env.

Start from `docs/deployment/NEO_PUBLIC_BETA_GATE_TEMPLATE.json`. The template intentionally does not pass validation until every placeholder is replaced with real values and every approval/evidence boolean is true.

This gate does not approve deployment by itself. It only proves the approval package is complete enough for the owner to make a deployment decision.

Existing-chain Neo deployment is a two-step process:

1. Roll the signed release to every validator with `scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh`, preserving all validator state.
2. After all validators are healthy on the new binary, activate Neo through the approved post-genesis governance payload from the manifest. Do not use fresh-genesis env variables on a running chain.

Fresh-genesis Neo deployment is a separate owner-approved reset or launch path:

1. Stop services and flush state only through `scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh` with the exact reset approval variables.
2. Seed-01 creates genesis with the approved `LICHEN_GENESIS_NEO_GAS_REWARDS_*` values and a passing NX-900 manifest.
3. Other validators join from empty chain state, keep their own validator keypairs, and sync from peers. No RocksDB state, genesis wallet, genesis keys, peer cache, or consensus WAL may be copied.

Developer-facing route, rewards, DEX, SDK, and PQ evidence examples live in `docs/guides/NEO_DEVELOPER_INTEGRATION.md`. Keep those examples aligned with this gate: examples may prove local integration, but public rewards activation still requires this manifest.

Local parity rehearsal must force the same gate even though local launchers set `LICHEN_LOCAL_DEV=1`:

```bash
export LICHEN_NEO_PUBLIC_BETA_GATE_REQUIRED=1
export LICHEN_NEO_PUBLIC_BETA_GATE_MANIFEST=tests/artifacts/nx-900-testnet-rehearsal-YYYYMMDD/neo-public-beta-gate-testnet.LOCAL_REHEARSAL_ONLY.json
```

For the clean seed/joiner proof, run V1 first and then start V2/V3 from empty chain state with their own validator keypairs:

```bash
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh start-reset-seed
./scripts/start-local-3validators.sh start-joiners-from-seed-sync
```

The V1 log must show `NX-900 Neo public beta gate: PASS` before genesis DB creation. V2/V3 must join by network sync only; do not copy RocksDB, genesis wallets, consensus WALs, or seed state into joiner directories.

The VPS clean-slate deployment path uses the same wrapper. If `LICHEN_GENESIS_NEO_GAS_REWARDS_ENABLE=1` is present in `/etc/lichen/env-<network>`, the genesis step must also carry `LICHEN_NEO_PUBLIC_BETA_GATE_MANIFEST` from that env file. Missing or failing gate validation is a deployment blocker.

### Neo liquidity corridor gate

Neo Liquidity Corridor incentives are a separate `NX-950` lane. They must not be bundled into base Neo route activation, Neo GAS rewards activation, or any unrelated release. Before any public `wNEO`/`wGAS` DEX incentive campaign starts, validate the lane manifest:

```bash
node scripts/qa/check_neo_liquidity_corridor_gate.js \
  --manifest /etc/lichen/neo-liquidity-corridor-gate-testnet.json
```

Start from `docs/deployment/NEO_LIQUIDITY_CORRIDOR_GATE_TEMPLATE.json`. The template intentionally does not pass validation until every placeholder is replaced, every required approval/evidence boolean is true, and at least one approved Neo pair is enabled.

The manifest is scoped to the existing `dex_rewards` contract and the existing Neo DEX pair IDs:

- `wNEO/lUSD`: pair and pool `8`
- `wNEO/LICN`: pair and pool `9`
- `wGAS/lUSD`: pair and pool `10`
- `wGAS/LICN`: pair and pool `11`

Current campaign activation uses a governed post-genesis payload that calls `dex_rewards.configure_lp_campaign` for the approved pair IDs, with the approved rate and per-pair budget from the manifest. Fresh chains follow the same path after genesis so reset and running-chain activation use one reviewable payload format. Do not add ad hoc genesis reward-rate shortcuts.

Fresh genesis and post-genesis deployments must wire LP accounting before any campaign payload is approved:

- `dex_amm.set_rewards_address(dex_rewards)`
- `dex_rewards.set_authorized_caller(dex_amm, enabled=true)`

This wiring only lets AMM positions sync LP reward accounting. It does not activate incentives until governed campaign rates and budgets are configured. Pausing a campaign sets the affected pair rates to zero; LP fee collection, liquidity removal, and bridge/user exits must remain available.

The gate requires product/governance/security/custody/legal/market-risk/deployment approvals, per-pool TVL/volume/reward caps, a funded LICN campaign budget, whole-lot `wNEO` preservation, route-pause behavior, user-exit proof, public disclosure, watchtower coverage, and local 3-validator DEX evidence with AMM, router, rewards, candles, and rollback checks.

Passing this checker does not deploy or activate the campaign. It only proves the approval packet and evidence are complete enough for the owner to decide whether to schedule activation.

Developers should treat the Neo Liquidity Corridor as an approved-manifest extension of the existing DEX rewards path. The public developer examples in `docs/guides/NEO_DEVELOPER_INTEGRATION.md` intentionally show pair IDs, LP pending surfaces, and `dex_rewards.configure_lp_campaign` without implying that a public incentive campaign is active.

### Neo ZK Proof Services Gate

Neo reserve/liability proof services are gated separately under `NX-960`:

```bash
node scripts/qa/check_neo_zk_proof_services_gate.js \
  --manifest /etc/lichen/neo-zk-proof-services-gate-testnet.json
```

Start from `docs/deployment/NEO_ZK_PROOF_SERVICES_GATE_TEMPLATE.json`. The template intentionally does not pass validation until product, governance, security, custody, legal/compliance, privacy, and deployment approvals are real, all local proof evidence is present, and the public disclosure/benchmark fields are filled.

The v1 proof statement is transparent aggregate reserve/liability only. It uses native Plonky3/FRI proof envelopes for `wNEO`, `wGAS`, and `NEOGASRWD` with public inputs for domain hash, statement hash, witness commitment, reserve amount, liability amount, epoch, and verifier version. Do not claim hidden-witness solvency or direct Neo X on-chain verification from this gate; those require a separate audited verifier lane.

Passing this checker does not deploy public proof services. It only proves the approval packet, privacy boundary, replay-rejection evidence, CLI/native/RPC/SDK verifier evidence, and local 3-validator exercise are complete enough for an owner decision.

### Neo Agent Compute Gate

Neo agent/compute cross-ecosystem flows are gated separately under `NX-980`:

```bash
node scripts/qa/check_neo_agent_compute_gate.js \
  --manifest /etc/lichen/neo-agent-compute-gate-testnet.json
```

The `NX-980` gate is for autonomous agent jobs paid through Neo-facing policy. It requires an opt-in agent spending policy, per-agent daily and per-task caps, a non-zero PQ agent-action hash for each agent-submitted job, route-pause behavior that blocks only new agent payments, and evidence that existing compute-market escrow exit paths remain available.

The compute-market contract exposes this through a separate policy path: `set_agent_compute_controls`, `set_agent_spending_policy`, `disable_agent_spending_policy`, `submit_agent_job`, and read-only policy/action helpers. Existing `submit_job`, provider registration, dispute, cancel, and release behavior are not changed by the Neo agent path.

Passing this checker does not deploy or activate public agent-compute flows. It only proves the approval packet, policy caps, PQ evidence, task-accounting evidence, no-regression evidence, and local 3-validator exercise are complete enough for an owner decision.

## Contract deployment and post-genesis bootstrap

Genesis auto-deploys the canonical contract catalog. LICN is native and is not part of that deployed contract set. Fresh local-testnet and mainnet genesis also creates the mandatory 13 launch DEX CLOB pairs, AMM pools, and router routes, including `wNEO`, `wGAS`, and `wBTC` markets. Rolling updates and live-chain additions are additive only; they must not delete state, rewrite historical roots, or make those fresh-genesis markets optional. Any post-genesis wrapped-token addition must be deployed, registered, initialized with the operational token admin, and verified through `getProgramStorage` before custody, DEX, wallet, or explorer surfaces are enabled for that asset.

After a supported local or VPS genesis node is healthy, the canonical post-genesis bootstrap step is `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh`.

Run it manually against a healthy validator when needed:

```bash
./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 --skip-build
```

Use `http://127.0.0.1:9899` for mainnet, or set `DEPLOY_NETWORK=mainnet` explicitly when bootstrapping against a mainnet RPC.

Use it without `--skip-build` if WASM artifacts are missing:

```bash
./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

What it does:

- waits for validator health
- rebuilds `deploy-manifest.json` from the live genesis-deployed symbol registry
- keeps local helper key material aligned with the genesis admin key
- generates a signed metadata manifest when Node.js and the release-signing key are present

For VPSes, run `scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh` after genesis creation to copy the genesis admin and faucet keypairs into the system paths expected by custody and faucet before you start those services.

Outputs to verify:

- `deploy-manifest.json`
- signed metadata manifest file
- healthy DEX pair list from `/api/v1/pairs`

Operational notes:

- On VPSes, run `scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh` from the operator-owned repo checkout, not from the `lichen` service account, unless the repo path is traversable by that account.
- The script now refuses to trust a stale `deploy-manifest.json` unless it matches the live symbol registry. Older copies of the repo can still carry stale manifests, so a clean-slate redeploy should treat that file as disposable.
- If the script generates the signed metadata file in the repo checkout, install it into `/etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-<net>.json` before relying on public browser flows.

Local convenience wrapper:

```bash
make deploy-local
```

## VPS Runbook

### Step 1: select and stage the signed release

Resolve the exact qualified tag from the dated deployment record. Verify the
successful immutable workflow, complete checksums, provenance attestations and
detached PQ signature against the recorded trust anchor. Stage the identical
signed binary and contract bundles on all four hosts. Keep configuration and
secrets in their approved host-local paths and preserve every validator's own
state, WAL, keys and rollback artifacts.

### Step 2: verify the staged artifacts

Require installed and running binary hashes to match the signed inventory after
the coordinated stop/install/start. Never rebuild a production binary on a VPS,
copy a locally built candidate, or sync an operator worktree over live files.
The full [deployment preflight](ARCHIVE_V2_DEPLOYMENT_PREFLIGHT.md) covers staged
inputs, stopped-process barriers, readiness deadlines and interrupted recovery.

Critical contract artifact invariant:

- Genesis replay reads the top-level tracked files `contracts/<name>/<name>.wasm`.
- `./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh` rewrites those top-level files.
- Never rebuild contracts on only the genesis host after staging the repo to joining validators. That changes deterministic program addresses and guarantees a genesis state-root mismatch.
- Install the one identical contract WASM bundle from the verified signed
  release on every validator. Never rebuild contracts on a validator VPS.
- Verify the installed top-level contract bundle hash matches on every VPS
  before creating genesis or starting joining validators.

Example verification command:

```bash
command find /var/lib/lichen/contracts -maxdepth 2 -name '*.wasm' | sort | xargs shasum -a 256 | shasum -a 256
```

### Step 3: install services and env files

Provision the base host once from the exact signed-release unit, env, and Caddy
templates plus the approved secret manager. Release upgrades then use the
coordinated signed-artifact deployer from the operator machine:

```bash
: "${LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG:?Set the qualified release tag from the deployment record}"
LICHEN_COORDINATED_RELEASE=1 \
  bash scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh testnet
```

The provisioned host layout contains:

- system user `lichen`
- `/etc/lichen`
- `/var/lib/lichen`
- `/var/log/lichen`
- `/etc/lichen/env-testnet` or `/etc/lichen/env-mainnet`
- validator, custody, and faucet systemd units

Redacted deployment env templates live at `deploy/env-testnet.example`,
`deploy/env-mainnet.example`, `deploy/custody-env.example`,
`deploy/custody-env-mainnet.example`, and `deploy/faucet-env.example`. They are
checked in CI against the systemd service contracts. Use them only
as templates for secret-manager provisioning; never commit filled copies.

Service names:

- `lichen-validator-testnet`
- `lichen-validator-mainnet`
- `lichen-custody`
- `lichen-custody-mainnet`
- `lichen-faucet` on testnet only

### Step 4: bootstrap the genesis VPS

Run these steps on the first validator only.

The approved secret manager provisions `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` in
`/etc/lichen/env-<net>` and the matching custody environment without printing
it. The validator, genesis builder, custody service, and threshold signer share
the canonical encrypted keypair format, so the same password must be present
anywhere those files are loaded.

To inspect or export your validator keypair at any time:

```bash
# Load the password
LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD=$(grep LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD /etc/lichen/env-testnet | cut -d= -f2-)
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD

# Show public key and EVM address
lichen identity export --keypair /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json

# Also reveal the private seed (handle with extreme care)
lichen identity export --keypair /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json --reveal-seed
```

1. Start the validator once so it generates `validator-keypair.json`, or verify the existing state-scoped keypair.
2. Record `publicKeyBase58` from that file and compare it to the expected host identity.
3. Stop the service, preserve the state-scoped keypair into a timestamped evidence directory, verify the preserved copy, and only then clear temporary state.
4. Prepare wallet artifacts.
5. Create the genesis DB.
6. Start the validator again.

Known public testnet validator identities:

| Host | Role | Validator identity |
|------|------|--------------------|
| `15.204.229.189` | seed-01 / US | `7LFPJ8gqmAtjbhfRg1P4VXmTQJV4AeZxzws3UsA6SVq` |
| `37.59.97.61` | seed-02 / EU | `6RMeoigHdJWB47pEZEMSj5gvT7nbJPYSfPqjcur9vMJ` |
| `15.235.142.253` | seed-03 / SEA | `6TghL7ioQz5R8pfrX1Qcfy8rNMzRP5F2pndmmRQ2sPm` |
| `148.113.43.247` | seed-04 / IN | `6XhsGituXoWSd1wLtutZgdJve6gLrdSi7YhEx1ZDFHW` |

Concrete sequence for testnet:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
EXPECTED_VALIDATOR_PUBKEY='<EXPECTED_HOST_VALIDATOR_IDENTITY>'
VALIDATOR_PUBKEY=$(sudo python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('/var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json'))['publicKeyBase58'])")
test "$VALIDATOR_PUBKEY" = "$EXPECTED_VALIDATOR_PUBKEY"
sudo systemctl stop lichen-validator-testnet

PRESERVE="/var/lib/lichen/identity-preserve-state-testnet-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
sudo install -d -m 700 -o root -g root "$PRESERVE/state-testnet"
sudo install -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \
  /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json \
  "$PRESERVE/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json"
sudo python3 - "$PRESERVE/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json" "$EXPECTED_VALIDATOR_PUBKEY" <<'PY'
import json
import sys
with open(sys.argv[1], encoding="utf-8") as fh:
    pubkey = json.load(fh)["publicKeyBase58"]
if pubkey != sys.argv[2]:
    raise SystemExit(f"preserved validator key mismatch: {pubkey} != {sys.argv[2]}")
PY

sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/.lichen
sudo install -d -m 750 -o lichen -g lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
sudo install -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \
  "$PRESERVE/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json" \
  /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json

cd ~/lichen
sudo -u lichen HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_CONTRACTS_DIR=/var/lib/lichen/contracts \
  LICHEN_GENESIS_BIN=/usr/local/bin/lichen-genesis \
  ./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network testnet --prepare-wallet --output-dir /var/lib/lichen/genesis-keys-testnet

sudo -u lichen HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_HOME=/var/lib/lichen LICHEN_CONTRACTS_DIR=/var/lib/lichen/contracts \
  LICHEN_GENESIS_BIN=/usr/local/bin/lichen-genesis \
  ./scripts/generate-genesis.sh \
  --network testnet \
  --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet \
  --wallet-file /var/lib/lichen/genesis-keys-testnet/genesis-wallet.json \
  --initial-validator <VALIDATOR_PUBKEY>

sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
```

Preserve the generated `validator-keypair.json` across the state wipe and verify the preserved copy before deletion. Do not restore from `/var/lib/lichen/validator-keypair-testnet.json` unless you first prove that file's `publicKeyBase58` matches the expected host identity; stale fallback key files can silently replace a real validator identity.

Each joining validator may start from an empty chain database but keeps its own
encrypted validator identity, node identity, WAL continuity evidence when
applicable, and pinned expected public key. Never copy another validator's key
or RocksDB directory to make a join appear healthy.

`lichen-genesis` fetches live genesis market prices from Binance first, then CoinGecko. Testnet may fall back to compiled defaults if both sources are unavailable; mainnet refuses that fallback. For mainnet or an audited reset, pass `--genesis-prices-file <path>` with `licn_usd_8dec`, `wsol_usd_8dec`, `weth_usd_8dec`, `wbnb_usd_8dec`, `wneo_usd_8dec`, `wgas_usd_8dec`, and `wbtc_usd_8dec` fields, or export `GENESIS_LICN_USD`, `GENESIS_SOL_USD`, `GENESIS_ETH_USD`, `GENESIS_BNB_USD`, `GENESIS_NEO_USD`, `GENESIS_GAS_USD`, and `GENESIS_BTC_USD` from a trusted snapshot. The current controlled LICN reference is `$0.15`; all seven environment values are an atomic override and partial sets fail closed.

### Step 5: run post-genesis deploy on the genesis VPS (MANDATORY)

After the validator is healthy, run the post-genesis deploy from the repo checkout on the genesis host as the checkout owner. **This step is required** — without it, the signed metadata manifest is not generated and all frontend portals (DEX, wallet, explorer, etc.) will fail to resolve contract addresses.

```bash
cd ~/lichen
DEPLOY_NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 --skip-build
```

For mainnet, run:

```bash
cd ~/lichen
DEPLOY_NETWORK=mainnet ./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:9899 --skip-build
```

This is the cleanest way to refresh the deploy manifest, helper key alignment, and signed metadata manifest in the current repo state.

The helper key alignment step now copies the encrypted `genesis-primary-*.json` file with mode `600`. That repo-local helper represents the current wrapped-token operational minter key used by local bootstrap flows, not the long-lived governed admin authority.

Do not copy the release signing key to the VPS. Generate the signed metadata manifest from the deployer machine through an SSH tunnel to the seed RPC, then upload only the signed JSON artifact:

```bash
# On the deployer machine:
export LICHEN_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR=${LICHEN_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR:-keypairs/release-signing-key.json}
ssh -p 2222 -N -L 127.0.0.1:19899:127.0.0.1:8899 ubuntu@15.204.229.189 &
TUNNEL_PID=$!
node scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js \
  --rpc http://127.0.0.1:19899 \
  --network testnet \
  --keypair "$LICHEN_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR" \
  --out /tmp/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
kill "$TUNNEL_PID"
rsync -az -e 'ssh -p 2222' \
  /tmp/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json \
  ubuntu@15.204.229.189:~/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json

# On the seed VPS:
cd ~/lichen
SIGNED_METADATA_MANIFEST=$HOME/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json \
  DEPLOY_NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/first-boot-deploy.sh --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 --skip-build
```

If the script generated the signed metadata file under `~/lichen/`, install it into the RPC-configured path before continuing. **Do not skip this step — the DEX and all frontends depend on it:**

```bash
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen \
  ~/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json \
  /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

Verify the manifest is served correctly:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); p=d['result']['payload']; print(f'{len(p.get(\"symbol_registry\",[]))} symbols in manifest')"
```

If this does not return the expected symbol count for the active genesis contract catalog (32 in the BTC-enabled catalog), check that the manifest file exists at the path configured by `LICHEN_SIGNED_METADATA_MANIFEST_FILE` in `/etc/lichen/env-<net>` and restart the validator.

### Step 6: join additional validators

On every joining VPS, verify the installed state seed file matches the staged release file:

```bash
cmp /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/seeds.json /etc/lichen/seeds.json
```

For mainnet, compare `/var/lib/lichen/state-mainnet/seeds.json` instead.

The signed release deployer installs the release's `seeds.json` to both
`/etc/lichen/seeds.json` and `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/seeds.json`. Joining
validators use that seed file directly; no bootstrap flags or env overrides are
required.

Copy the signed metadata manifest from the genesis VPS to each joining VPS, so all nodes serve the same contract address data to frontends:

```bash
# From genesis VPS:
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json ubuntu@<JOINING_VPS>:~/
# On joining VPS:
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen \
  ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json \
  /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
rm ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

Do not copy `genesis-wallet.json`, `genesis-keys/`, RocksDB files, `known-peers.json`, or consensus WAL to joining validators. A joining validator needs only:

- its own encrypted `validator-keypair.json`
- `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/seeds.json`
- `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` in `/etc/lichen/env-<net>`
- optional service-only files if this host also runs custody/faucet

Then start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet
```

### Step 7: custody and faucet

Provision custody env files and secret material through the approved host-local
secret workflow before enabling custody.

Run `scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh` after genesis creation so `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` is populated from the encrypted `genesis-primary-*.json` artifact with secure permissions. Despite the historical path name, this file is now the wrapped-token operational minter key used by custody for `mint()` flows; wrapped-token admin and contract ownership move to governance during genesis.

Provision before starting custody:

- `/etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt`
- `/etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt`

Or the mainnet equivalents.

Permission model for those files matters:

- `/etc/lichen/secrets` must be `root:lichen` with mode `750`.
- Seed files must be `root:lichen` with mode `640`.
- `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` must remain `lichen:lichen` with mode `600`.
- `LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD` must be present in `/etc/lichen/custody-env` or `/etc/lichen/custody-env-mainnet` before custody starts, because that service now loads the same canonical encrypted keypair JSON used by genesis and validator helpers.
- If you provision them as `root:root 600`, `lichen-custody` will fail with `Permission denied`.

Wrapped-token authority split after genesis:

- contract owner and wrapped-token admin live under the governance authority
- custody keeps the current wrapped-token minter key until governance executes `set_minter`
- wrapped-token attester rotation now runs through the oracle-committee approval lane via `set_attester`
- cold admin transfer remains on the governance root via `transfer_admin` and `accept_admin`

Then start the services:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-custody
sudo systemctl start lichen-faucet
```

For mainnet, start custody only:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lichen-custody-mainnet
```

Mainnet uses `lichen-custody-mainnet` and has no faucet.

When a VPS is expected to serve public bridge intake through RPC, the validator
service env for that network must also include:

- `CUSTODY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9105` when custody runs locally on the same VPS,
- `CUSTODY_API_AUTH_TOKEN` matching the local custody service token.

The custody env must resolve wrapped-token route contracts to the current
on-chain symbol registry after every reset, genesis rebuild, or mainnet launch.
Pinned `CUSTODY_LUSD_TOKEN_ADDR`, `CUSTODY_WSOL_TOKEN_ADDR`,
`CUSTODY_WETH_TOKEN_ADDR`, `CUSTODY_WBNB_TOKEN_ADDR`,
`CUSTODY_WGAS_TOKEN_ADDR`, `CUSTODY_WNEO_TOKEN_ADDR`, and
`CUSTODY_WBTC_TOKEN_ADDR` values must be updated or removed before custody starts; stale addresses from a previous chain will
make `createBridgeDeposit` fail after route restrictions are lifted. Validate
the bridge route through the public RPC and each direct VPS RPC:

```bash
lichen --rpc-url https://testnet-api.lichen.network restriction status bridge-route solana sol
```

### Step 8: external ingress and browser smoke tests

Do not stop after internal `127.0.0.1` health checks. Validate the public path that browsers will actually use.

For public testnet:

```bash
curl -si -X OPTIONS https://testnet-api.lichen.network/ \
  -H 'Origin: https://dex.lichen.network' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type'

curl -s https://testnet-api.lichen.network/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'

curl -s https://testnet-api.lichen.network/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getIncidentStatus","params":[]}'

curl -s https://testnet-api.lichen.network/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}'

python3 - <<'PY'
import subprocess
payload = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"subscribeSlots","params":null}\n'
for i in range(1, 11):
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["websocat", "-n1", "wss://testnet-api.lichen.network/ws"],
        input=payload,
        text=True,
        capture_output=True,
        timeout=6,
    )
    if result.returncode != 0 or '"result"' not in result.stdout:
        raise SystemExit(f"WebSocket attempt {i} failed: {result.stderr or result.stdout}")
print("WebSocket subscribeSlots: 10/10")
PY

python3 - <<'PY'

last_error = None

def get_json(path):
    request = urllib.request.Request(
        base + path,
        headers={
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "User-Agent": "lichen-deploy-smoke/1.0",
        },
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(request, timeout=8) as response:
        return json.loads(response.read().decode())

        feeds = {feed.get("asset"): feed for feed in oracle.get("data", {}).get("feeds", [])}
        bad = []
        for asset in ("wSOL", "wETH", "wBNB", "wNEO", "wGAS", "wBTC"):
            feed = feeds.get(asset) or {}
            if int(feed.get("slot") or 0) <= 0 or feed.get("stale") is True:
                bad.append(f"{asset}:slot={feed.get('slot')} stale={feed.get('stale')}")
        candles = get_json("/api/v1/pairs/2/candles?interval=60&limit=4")

            break

    except Exception as exc:
        last_error = str(exc)
    time.sleep(3)
else:
    raise SystemExit(f"DEX oracle/candle smoke failed: {last_error}")
PY
```

Confirm the canonical testnet custom domain serves both RPC and WebSocket
traffic through the same Worker:

```bash
dig +short testnet-api.lichen.network
websocat -n1 wss://testnet-api.lichen.network/ws
```

If `testnet-ws.lichen.network` or `ws.lichen.network` resolves directly to validator IPs and presents an untrusted origin certificate, do not advertise it to clients. Use the RPC-hosted `/ws` endpoint until DNS is proxied through the edge or the origin has a public CA certificate.

If mainnet-cutover portals are expected to stay usable, run the same checks against `https://rpc.lichen.network` and `wss://rpc.lichen.network/ws` too. Current pre-mainnet production portals default to `testnet`; after the explicit mainnet cutover, a dead mainnet origin will surface as frontend CORS, incident-status, signed-metadata, and missing-contract-address errors even while `testnet-rpc.lichen.network` is healthy.

### Step 9: day-2 operations

Useful commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl status lichen-validator-testnet
sudo journalctl -u lichen-validator-testnet -n 200 --no-pager
sudo systemctl status lichen-custody
sudo journalctl -u lichen-custody -n 200 --no-pager
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
```

Firewall minimums:

- HTTP ingress: `80/tcp`
- HTTPS ingress: `443/tcp`
- testnet P2P: `7001/tcp`
- mainnet P2P: `8001/tcp`

Expose RPC, WS, faucet, custody, and Moss only through the reverse proxy layout you actually operate. The supported repo-managed layout lives in `deploy/Caddyfile.common`, the network/custody fragments, and the regional `deploy/Caddyfile.*-moss-*` fragments. Approved host-local automation composes those exact signed fragments and validates the final Caddyfile before install. On testnet, only the US custody origin at `15.204.229.189` proxies `custody-testnet.lichen.network` to local `127.0.0.1:9105`; the other validator origins install the custody forwarder so Cloudflare cannot route custody traffic to an empty local port. Mainnet custody is defined in `deploy/Caddyfile.mainnet-us` on `127.0.0.1:9106`.

### Step 10: backup, restore, and disaster recovery

Do not use `reset-blockchain.sh` on VPS hosts. That script is intentionally limited to local and developer reset flows and is not the supported production restore path.

The authoritative backup set for a VPS validator is:

- `/etc/lichen/env-<net>`
- `/etc/lichen/custody-env` on testnet or `/etc/lichen/custody-env-mainnet` on mainnet
- `/etc/lichen/secrets/`
- `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` (wrapped-token operational minter key)
- `/etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-<net>.json`
- `/etc/lichen/incident-status-<net>.json`
- `/etc/lichen/service-fleet-<net>.json`
- `/etc/lichen/key-hierarchy.md`
- `/etc/lichen/drill-register.md`
- `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>`
- `/var/lib/lichen/.lichen`
- `/var/lib/lichen/service-fleet-status-<net>.json`
- `/var/lib/lichen/custody-db` on testnet or `/var/lib/lichen/custody-db-mainnet` on mainnet
- testnet only: `/var/lib/lichen/faucet-keypair-testnet.json` and `/var/lib/lichen/airdrops.json`

Identity-critical files live inside that set. In particular, do not lose `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/validator-keypair.json` or `/var/lib/lichen/.lichen/node_identity.json`, or the node will come back with a different validator or P2P identity.

Neo X custody parity is part of the deployment gate. When Neo X is enabled, every public RPC/custody host must have the same route keys in the active custody env file:

- `CUSTODY_NEOX_RPC_URL`
- `CUSTODY_NEOX_CHAIN_ID`
- `CUSTODY_NEOX_NEO_TOKEN_ADDR`

Do not leave those keys only on the genesis host. Public RPC proxies bridge-deposit calls to the local custody service on each host, so a host without the route env will fail NEO/GAS deposit creation even when chain route status reads as active.

`keypairs/deployer.json` is repo-local/private material and must not be synced to VPSes. If a previous deployment left an old root-owned copy on a host, an rsync warning about that path is not a chain-state issue; the fix is to exclude the file from code sync and keep the canonical deployer key in the approved operator secret path. Do not chmod, overwrite, or copy that old file to make rsync quiet.

The exact signed release can recreate `/var/lib/lichen/contracts` and the checked-in systemd units, but include them in the backup if you want a faster single-archive restore and an easier offline drill.

Create an offline snapshot with services stopped. Start from the repo release that is actually running on the host.

```bash

If the restore archive did not include `/etc/lichen/custody-treasury-<net>.json` or the faucet keypair, but `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>/genesis-keys` was restored, repopulate those service-facing files before restarting custody or faucet:

```bash
cd ~/lichen
sudo bash scripts/vps-post-genesis.sh "$NET" --no-restart
```

After the node is healthy, run the same public smoke tests from Step 8 and update the deployed `/etc/lichen/drill-register.md` with the restore transcript, checksum verification, recovered file inventory, and owner signoff. The quarterly offline backup restore drill in `docs/deployment/ROTATION_AND_RESTORE_DRILLS.md` should use this exact sequence.

## Manual single-node debugging

Use `lichen-start.sh` only when you need a manual, foreground, or one-off debugging flow instead of the supported local launcher or VPS systemd path.

Examples:

```bash
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='set-a-long-random-secret-before-first-start'
./lichen-start.sh testnet --foreground
mkdir -p ./data/state-mainnet
cp ./seeds.json ./data/state-mainnet/seeds.json
export LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD='set-a-long-random-secret-before-first-start'
./lichen-start.sh mainnet
```

Notes:

- `--custody` is restricted to explicit local development
- this script is useful for manual debugging, but not the canonical steady-state service model

## Release signing and signed metadata

### Sign a release artifact set

The tag workflow creates the canonical `SHA256SUMS` and draft release. A
maintainer signs those exact bytes with the offline release signer and attaches
the resulting JSON-encoded native PQ `SHA256SUMS.sig` to the draft. Release
private-key generation, storage, and signing tooling are deliberately outside
the public repository. The signer address must remain identical to
`deploy/release-trust-anchor.json` and `validator/src/updater.rs`.

Before publication, verify the detached signature from a clean checkout:

```bash
node scripts/verify-release-checksums.mjs /path/to/downloaded-release-assets
```

Never regenerate `SHA256SUMS` after signing, and never publish a draft that is
missing the signature or whose signer differs from the pinned trust anchor.

### Generate a signed metadata manifest

Local example:

```bash
export SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR=/secure/local-signing/release-signing-keypair.json

node scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js \
  --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 \
  --network local-testnet \
  --keypair "$SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR" \
  --out ./signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

VPS example:

```bash
node scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js \
  --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8899 \
  --network testnet \
  --keypair /secure/offline-mounted/release-signing-keypair.json \
  --out /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

The local 3-validator launcher generates this manifest automatically.

On VPS deploys, `first-boot-deploy.sh` must now regenerate the manifest, install it into the configured `/etc/lichen/` target, and verify that the validator serves the expected DEX-related symbol registry entries back through `getSignedMetadataManifest`. If Node.js, the release-signing keypair, or the install step is missing, the deploy fails instead of continuing half-configured.

`first-boot-deploy.sh` never reads a signing key from the validator service environment. Mount the key only for the bootstrap command and export `SIGNED_METADATA_KEYPAIR`; remove the mount when the signed artifact is installed.

## ZK proof generation

Build the proof CLI:

```bash
cargo build --release -p lichen-cli --bin zk-prove
```

Generate proofs:

```bash
./target/release/zk-prove shield --amount 1000000000
./target/release/zk-prove unshield --amount 1000000000 --merkle-root <hex> --recipient <hex> --blinding <hex> --serial <hex>
./target/release/zk-prove transfer --transfer-json ./transfer-witness.json
```

The proof CLI writes JSON to stdout. That JSON is the input for the transaction-building side of the shielded flow.

Verifier note:

- Lichen uses transparent STARK proofs
- there is no separate trusted setup ceremony to ship to operators
- the verifier lives in the validator runtime; operators do not manually distribute a static trusted verifier key bundle as part of the normal deployment path

## Frontend and portal deployment

Static portals deploy through Cloudflare Pages. Current project names use the `lichen-network-` prefix.

Important behavior:

- Current pre-mainnet production portals default to `testnet`.
- The mainnet launch cutover requires changing each portal's `shared-config.js` `productionPrimaryNetwork`/visible-network policy to `mainnet`, then redeploying through Cloudflare Pages.
- After that cutover, a successful testnet rollout only makes the portals work if either the user switches to `testnet` or `rpc.lichen.network` is also healthy.

| Portal | Project name | Directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| website | `lichen-network-website` | `website/` |
| explorer | `lichen-network-explorer` | `explorer/` |
| wallet | `lichen-network-wallet` | `wallet/` |
| dex | `lichen-network-dex` | `dex/` |
| marketplace | `lichen-network-marketplace` | `marketplace/` |
| programs | `lichen-network-programs` | `programs/` |
| developers | `lichen-network-developers` | `developers/` |
| monitoring | `lichen-network-monitoring` | `monitoring/` |
| faucet | `lichen-network-faucet` | `faucet/` |

Supported repo deploy command:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-cloudflare-pages.sh <portal>
```

The wrapper runs the frontend asset audit, stages the selected portal into a clean temp directory, verifies required staged assets such as the DEX TradingView bundle, and then calls Wrangler from that staged `--cwd`.

Require a clean committed source, a sealed export manifest and matching public
asset/browser acceptance. Follow [verified frontend exports](#deploy-verified-frontend-exports)
for the final command and interrupted-deployment handling.

`faucet-service` is the VPS/API backend. The browser faucet portal in `faucet/` is a separate Cloudflare Pages project: `lichen-network-faucet`.

## Final operator checklist

Before you call a deployment complete, verify all of the following:

- validator health returns `ok`
- expected contracts are present
- signed metadata manifest exists and is current
- local or VPS DEX pair list is populated
- custody and faucet health endpoints respond if those services are enabled
- external CORS preflight and JSON-RPC checks succeed for every public RPC hostname you expect browsers to use
- `getIncidentStatus` and `getSignedMetadataManifest` succeed through the public edge, not just on `127.0.0.1`
- release artifacts are signed if you are cutting an upgrade
- `zk-prove` builds and runs if you are validating privacy flows

Useful checks:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899/api/v1/pairs | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9105/health | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9100/health | python3 -m json.tool
ls -l deploy-manifest.json signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

If this document and the scripts ever disagree, trust the scripts first and then update this runbook immediately.

## Oracle price feed configuration

The oracle price feeder is **built into the validator binary** — there is no separate oracle service or market-maker process. Every running `lichen-validator` instance spawns `spawn_oracle_price_feeder()` which:

1. Opens a WebSocket to Binance for real-time aggregate trades (`solusdt`, `ethusdt`, `bnbusdt`, `neousdt`, `gasusdt`, `btcusdt`).
2. Falls back to REST polling (`/api/v3/ticker/price`) every 5 seconds if the WS connection drops.
3. Stores prices in shared atomics (`SharedOraclePrices`).
4. Submits oracle-attestation transactions (system opcode 30) into the mempool every 5 seconds.
5. Broadcasts WS ticker and candle events to connected DEX frontend clients.

### Env vars

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LICHEN_ORACLE_WS_URL` | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/solusdt@aggTrade/ethusdt@aggTrade/bnbusdt@aggTrade/neousdt@aggTrade/gasusdt@aggTrade/btcusdt@aggTrade` | Binance WebSocket stream |
| `LICHEN_ORACLE_REST_URL` | `https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT","ETHUSDT","BNBUSDT","NEOUSDT","GASUSDT","BTCUSDT"]` | Binance REST fallback |
| `LICHEN_DISABLE_ORACLE` | unset | Set to `1` to disable the oracle entirely |

### US VPS geo-block

`api.binance.com` and `stream.binance.com` return HTTP 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons) from US IP addresses. If the validator is hosted on a US VPS, you **must** override both URLs to use Binance US:

```
LICHEN_ORACLE_WS_URL=wss://stream.binance.us:9443/ws/solusdt@aggTrade/ethusdt@aggTrade/bnbusdt@aggTrade/neousdt@aggTrade/gasusdt@aggTrade/btcusdt@aggTrade
LICHEN_ORACLE_REST_URL=https://api.binance.us/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT","ETHUSDT","BNBUSDT","NEOUSDT","GASUSDT","BTCUSDT"]
```

The approved host baseline sets these overrides on the current OVH US host. For
other US hosting providers, explicitly set and verify the env vars in
`/etc/lichen/env-<net>`.

### Diagnosing silent oracle failures

If the DEX shows static prices that never move:

1. Check validator logs for Binance connection errors:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u lichen-validator-testnet --no-pager | grep -i 'oracle\|binance\|price' | tail -20
   ```
2. Test the REST endpoint from the VPS:
   ```bash
   curl -sf 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT"]' || echo "BLOCKED"
   curl -sf 'https://api.binance.us/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT"]' || echo "BLOCKED"
   ```
3. Verify env vars are loaded:
   ```bash
   grep ORACLE /etc/lichen/env-testnet
   ```

### Genesis price seeding

The genesis builder reads `GENESIS_LICN_USD`, `GENESIS_SOL_USD`, `GENESIS_ETH_USD`, `GENESIS_BNB_USD`, `GENESIS_NEO_USD`, `GENESIS_GAS_USD`, and `GENESIS_BTC_USD` as one complete set to seed initial oracle prices into genesis state. If the configured market-data endpoint is blocked on the genesis host, capture all external prices from a trusted fallback before running `lichen-genesis`:

```bash
# From a non-US machine or your local dev box:
curl -s 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbols=["SOLUSDT","ETHUSDT","BNBUSDT","NEOUSDT","GASUSDT","BTCUSDT"]'
# Then export on the genesis host:
export GENESIS_LICN_USD=0.15
export GENESIS_SOL_USD=170.50
export GENESIS_ETH_USD=2650.00
export GENESIS_BNB_USD=620.00
export GENESIS_NEO_USD=3.10
export GENESIS_GAS_USD=1.65
export GENESIS_BTC_USD=100000.00
```

Bridge and oracle committees are also genesis state. A clean 4-validator deployment must pre-generate all four validator keypairs before `lichen-genesis`, then pass each planned validator pubkey with both `--bridge-validator <pubkey>` and `--oracle-operator <pubkey>`. Do not patch these committees after genesis for a clean reset.

---

## Release signing key management (critical)

### The canonical signing key

The deployer machine must have access to the release signing keypair, normally through `LICHEN_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR` or a local `keypairs/release-signing-key.json`. Its public key (`8HitBNnh8qbhfne5NCv2yHrQFoD6xbmHcWaUSgCGtsk`) is hardcoded in every frontend portal's `shared/utils.js` as `LICHEN_SIGNED_METADATA_SIGNERS`.

### The fatal mistake: generating keys on VPS

**NEVER generate or rotate a release-signing key on a VPS.** A newly generated
key has a different public identity. Metadata signed with it will be rejected by
every frontend portal because the signer does not match the pinned trust anchor.

### Correct signing key use

Never deploy the private release signing key to validator or custody VPSes. Use it on the deployer machine only to sign release checksum manifests and signed metadata manifests, then upload the resulting public artifact.

```bash
export LICHEN_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR=/secure/local-signing/release-signing-keypair.json
node scripts/generate-signed-metadata-manifest.js \
  --rpc http://127.0.0.1:<ssh-tunnel-port> \
  --network <testnet|mainnet> \
  --keypair "$LICHEN_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR" \
  --out /tmp/signed-metadata-manifest-<net>.json
```

Upload only the signed metadata JSON:

```bash
rsync -az -e 'ssh -p 2222' \
  /tmp/signed-metadata-manifest-<net>.json \
  ubuntu@<seed-vps>:~/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-<net>.json
```

### Verification

After deploying, verify the signed metadata manifest uses the expected signer:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSignedMetadataManifest","params":[]}' \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
d = json.load(sys.stdin)
r = d['result']
print(f\"Signer: {r['signer']}\")
assert r['signer'] == '8HitBNnh8qbhfne5NCv2yHrQFoD6xbmHcWaUSgCGtsk', 'WRONG SIGNER KEY'
p = r['payload']
print(f\"Symbols: {len(p.get('symbol_registry', []))}\")"
```

## Secrets distribution for joining validators

When EU and SEA also run custody/faucet service roles, these service files must be copied from the genesis VPS. These are not validator join requirements, and they are not sent to external validators:

| File | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `custody-master-seed-testnet.txt` | Genesis VPS `/etc/lichen/secrets/` | Custody HD wallet root |
| `custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt` | Genesis VPS `/etc/lichen/secrets/` | Custody deposit address derivation |
| `signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json` | Genesis VPS `/etc/lichen/` | Pre-generated signed manifest |
| `custody-treasury-testnet.json` | Genesis VPS `/etc/lichen/` | Custody wrapped-token operational key |
| `faucet-keypair-testnet.json` | Genesis VPS `/var/lib/lichen/` | Testnet faucet funding key |

Copy procedure (genesis VPS → joining VPS):

```bash
# From genesis VPS:
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt ubuntu@<JOINING_IP>:~/
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/secrets/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt ubuntu@<JOINING_IP>:~/
scp -P 2222 /etc/lichen/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json ubuntu@<JOINING_IP>:~/

# On joining VPS:
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt /etc/lichen/secrets/
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt /etc/lichen/secrets/
sudo install -m 640 -o root -g lichen ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json /etc/lichen/
rm ~/custody-master-seed-testnet.txt ~/custody-deposit-seed-testnet.txt ~/signed-metadata-manifest-testnet.json
```

Do not distribute `genesis-wallet.json` or `genesis-keys/` to validator joiners. Raw `requestAirdrop` on an independent validator may report `"Treasury keypair not configured"`; the faucet service is the supported funding path.

---

## Complete clean-slate VPS redeployment checklist

This is the full step-by-step procedure for stopping everything, flushing all state, and redeploying from scratch so VPSes match the live validator set exactly.

This destructive checklist does not apply to the current July testnet or
`v0.5.224`. The completed deployment preserved `v0.5.223` as the signed rollback
anchor and followed the in-place archive repair and coordinated resume gate
above. Keep this section only for a future, separately approved network whose
chain identity is intentionally being replaced.

The `testnet_governed_signer_recovery_v1` hook is live-testnet lineage recovery
only. It must not be copied into a fresh mainnet launch plan or treated as a
custody pattern. Before mainnet launch, verify governed signer custody with
`scripts/verify-governed-key-custody.sh`, preserve at least two private/offline
backups, and hard-stop if any live signer role is missing.

`v0.5.224` and later automatically enable archive mode for every non-dev
`testnet` and `mainnet` validator and derive `archive-<network>` beside its
`state-<network>` directory. Public runtime `--archive-mode` and `--cold-store`
flags fail startup.
Public validators are archive-backed RPC nodes, not state-only snapshot
consumers. Explicit local `--dev-mode` remains lightweight for disposable
developer clusters.

State divergence must be corrected by normal replay or by the full verified
checkpoint snapshot path. Verified snapshots require authenticated PQ node
sources and a self-contained canonical proof: the parent certificate, its
transaction-0 Merkle inclusion in a signed and finalized child header, the
child's complete historical power denominator, and the parent post-effects root
committed by that certificate. Snapshot bytes and the source-pinned archive
manifest must match that root before import. The validator may self-repair one
missing parent-producer counter only when every block-bound economic marker is
complete and an uncommitted one-increment candidate produces the already
verified child's exact parent root. This is certificate-constrained crash/race
recovery, not a local-history counter rewrite. Every nonmatching divergence
must use verified checkpoint repair; operators must never edit the stake-pool
singleton directly.

If a validator was mistakenly registered through the explicit funded path while it should enter bootstrap recovery, first roll a signed release that supports `ReclassifyValidatorBootstrap`, then submit the validator-signed correction:

```bash
lichen --rpc-url https://testnet-rpc.lichen.network validator reclassify-bootstrap \
  --keypair /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json
```

The transaction is only valid for an existing exact 100,000 LICN explicit-funded stake entry with no prior bootstrap debt, repayment, or graduation state. Do not edit the stake-pool RocksDB singleton directly.

### One-command automated redeploy (recommended)

```bash
export LICHEN_OWNER_APPROVED_RESET='owner-approved:testnet:15.204.229.189,37.59.97.61,15.235.142.253,148.113.43.247'
export LICHEN_CLEAN_SLATE_REDEPLOY_CONFIRM='clean-slate:testnet:15.204.229.189,37.59.97.61,15.235.142.253,148.113.43.247'
export LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z
bash scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh testnet
```

For mainnet, use the same host list with `owner-approved:mainnet:...` and `clean-slate:mainnet:...`, then run `bash scripts/clean-slate-redeploy.sh mainnet`. This path is destructive and requires explicit owner approval before use.

The script requires `LICHEN_RELEASE_TAG`; it downloads the GitHub Release archives, verifies `SHA256SUMS`, installs `lichen-validator`, `lichen-genesis`, `lichen`, `zk-prove`, `lichen-custody`, `lichen-faucet`, and bundled `seeds.json` from those archives, and verifies the installed binary hashes. It must not overwrite those runtime binaries from any remote `target/release` directory.

This is the canonical way to perform an owner-approved full reset. It is not the normal path for code-only releases; use `scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh` for those. It performs ALL reset phases automatically in ~3 minutes:

Use this path for any partial bootstrap or slot-0 bootstrap mismatch observed on one or more validators (for example: local DB claims progress but fails the canonical slot-0 state import). The cleanup model is a full state flush, not partial state file surgery.

| Phase | What it does | Typical time |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. Stop | Stops all services on all 4 VPSes, opens UFW port for cross-VPS RPC | ~9s |
| 2. Flush | Removes all state, custody DB, manifests | ~7s |
| 3. Sync + Build | Rsyncs code to all VPSes, builds binaries + WASM contracts on genesis VPS, distributes WASM to joiners | ~37s |
| 4. Validator identities | Pre-generates the validator keypair on each VPS and uses those exact four pubkeys for bridge/oracle genesis committees | ~5s |
| 5. Genesis | Prepares wallet, fetches live prices, creates genesis block with seed-only consensus plus 4-key bridge/oracle committees, starts genesis validator | ~14s |
| 6. Post-genesis | Runs `vps-post-genesis.sh`, installs signing key, verifies bridge/oracle readiness via `first-boot-deploy.sh`, provisions custody seeds | ~13s |
| 7. Service secrets | Bundles only custody/faucet/signing service secrets and signed metadata, then distributes those to joining VPSes; no RocksDB chain state is copied | ~20s |
| 8. Start joiners | Starts validators from their pre-generated keypairs and empty chain state, waits for genesis/block sync from peers, starts network-specific custody, and starts faucet on testnet only | ~30s to 5m |
| 9. Verify | Checks health/slot/genesis treasury or joiner treasury absence/protocol bootstrap/faucet/manifest on all 4 nodes, plus Cloudflare RPC health/protocol and public faucet health | ~37s |

Key design decisions:
- **No chain-state distribution**: Joining validators do not receive `CURRENT`, `MANIFEST-*`, `*.sst`, `genesis-wallet.json`, `genesis-keys/`, `known-peers.json`, or consensus WAL from the seed. They fetch the authoritative genesis config from seed RPC using `seeds.json`, then replay/sync blocks through the normal network path. This is the same model external agent-operated validators use.
- **Bridge/oracle bootstrap**: All four validator pubkeys are generated before genesis and embedded as bridge validators plus oracle operators. Only the seed validator is in the slot-zero consensus set so block production can start before joiners are online.
- **WASM distribution**: WASM contracts are built only on the genesis VPS and distributed via tarball — not compiled independently on each VPS.
- **Atomic service secrets**: Service secrets (custody treasury, custody seeds, faucet keypair on testnet, signed metadata manifest, signing key) are bundled into a single tarball per joining VPS — no partial copies. Validator chain state and treasury genesis keys are not included.
- **Cloudflare verification is service-aware**: `testnet-rpc.lichen.network` may round-robin to independent joiner validators that correctly do not hold raw genesis treasury material. The clean-slate verifier must validate public funding through `https://faucet.lichen.network`, not raw `requestAirdrop` on every public RPC origin.
- **SSH retry**: All SSH operations retry 3 times with exponential backoff (3s, 6s, 12s).
- **Code delivery**: Uses `rsync` (not `git pull`) since VPSes don't have `.git`.

### Recovery decision tree (on-call)

Use this to map symptoms to action quickly:

1. On startup, if logs show `⚠️  Detected partial genesis replay state without a stored slot-0 block`, the node has triggered the built-in partial-bootstrap recovery. Wait for a single restart cycle; if it remains online and catches peers, continue monitoring.
2. If the same node keeps at slot 0 and repeats slot-0 bootstrap errors, check startup output for `No genesis config found`, `GENESIS_SYNC_INCOMPLETE_MARKER`, or non-zero tip + missing genesis. If confirmed, execute the owner-approved full reset path (stop all services, flush every validator state path, rerun clean-slate redeploy).
3. If only one validator was previously wiped, confirm the root cause is intentional restart/rebuild; if TOFU or key identity drift is suspected, preserve or restore that validator's `validator-keypair.json`/`home/.lichen/node_identity.json` before continuing, or run full redeploy for all validators.
4. If RPC/custody/faucet services fail after chain is healthy, do not touch state. Pause service start-up and fix service secret/config ownership/permissions first, then restart services.
5. If chain state appears inconsistent across all nodes (health diverges, repeated root errors, repeated stalls), escalate to manual incident review and perform an owner-approved VPS nuclear reset only after evidence is captured.

Prerequisites:
- SSH access to all 4 VPSes (port 2222, user `ubuntu`, key-based auth)
- the audited base host layout already exists on every VPS (systemd units,
  users, directories, root-owned env files, and Caddy ingress)
- release signing key available only on the deployer machine
- Code committed and pushed to main

### Retired historical manual reset procedure

The former rsync/build-on-VPS/setup procedure was removed because it violated the current signed-release boundary and encouraged destructive state handling. Do not reconstruct it from old commits or handovers.

Normal upgrades use `scripts/rolling-release-deploy.sh` with exact signed tag artifacts; consensus/storage changes use coordinated mode. A clean-slate reset is exceptional, destructive, separately owner-approved, and must still install only signed release artifacts while preserving validator identities and required evidence.

## Deployment postmortem: known pitfalls

This section documents actual deployment failures and their root causes, so they are never repeated.

### Pitfall 1: Signed metadata trust drift or stale DEX assets

**Symptom**: DEX shows "Missing contract addresses", all frontends fail to load token metadata.

**Root cause**: The live chain symbol registry may still be correct, but the
frontend rejects or misses it when the signed metadata trust anchor in
`shared/utils.js` does not match the signer of `getSignedMetadataManifest`, or
when Cloudflare serves stale metadata-critical assets (`shared/utils.js`,
`shared-config.js`, `dex.js`) after a release. Historically this also happened
when a VPS generated a new release signing key instead of using the canonical
operator key. Do not reset chain state for this symptom until the signer,
manifest, and custom-domain assets have been proven correct.

**Fix**: Align the public trust anchor and the manifest signer, regenerate
signed metadata only with the canonical release-signing key, bump DEX asset
query tokens, redeploy Cloudflare Pages, and verify the custom domain returns
the new HTML and signer-bearing `shared/utils.js`.

**Prevention**: Before every validator rollout or frontend publish, run:

```bash
node scripts/qa/test_release_signer_trust_anchor.js
node scripts/qa/test_frontend_asset_integrity.js
```

Then smoke the public DEX path:

```bash
EXPECTED_RELEASE_SIGNER="8HitBNnh8qbhfne5NCv2yHrQFoD6xbmHcWaUSgCGtsk"
DEX_URL="https://dex.lichen.network"
DEX_ASSET_VERSION="$(grep -o 'dex.js?v=[0-9]*' dex/index.html | head -1 | cut -d= -f2)"

curl -fsSL "$DEX_URL/index.html" | grep "shared/utils.js?v=$DEX_ASSET_VERSION"
curl -fsSL "$DEX_URL/shared/utils.js?v=$DEX_ASSET_VERSION" | grep "$EXPECTED_RELEASE_SIGNER"
curl -fsSI "$DEX_URL/shared/utils.js?v=$DEX_ASSET_VERSION" | grep -i '^cache-control:'
```

If the custom domain applies a positive JavaScript TTL, configure/purge the
Cloudflare zone cache rule or bump every metadata-critical asset token and
record the evidence. The operator must provision the canonical release key
through the approved secret workflow; host provisioning must never generate a
replacement signing key.

### Pitfall 2: US VPS oracle geo-block

**Symptom**: DEX prices are static — they load from genesis but never update. Local 3-validator cluster works fine.

**Root cause**: The US VPS at `15.204.229.189` cannot reach `api.binance.com` / `stream.binance.com` (HTTP 451 geo-block). The validator's oracle feeder silently fails, no attestation transactions are submitted, and prices never move.

**Fix**: Set `LICHEN_ORACLE_WS_URL` and `LICHEN_ORACLE_REST_URL` to binance.us endpoints in `/etc/lichen/env-testnet`.

**Prevention**: The approved host baseline pins and verifies the US host's
`binance.us` overrides.

### Pitfall 3: Stale deploy-manifest.json

**Symptom**: `first-boot-deploy.sh` fails or generates incorrect signed metadata.

**Root cause**: An old `deploy-manifest.json` from a previous deployment was carried into the new rsync. The script detects a mismatch with the live symbol registry.

**Fix**: Delete `deploy-manifest.json` and `signed-metadata-manifest-*.json` from the repo checkout on the VPS before running `first-boot-deploy.sh`.

### Pitfall 4: Cargo not in PATH on VPS

**Symptom**: `cargo build` fails with "command not found" over SSH.

**Root cause**: SSH non-login shells don't source `~/.cargo/env`. Running `ssh host 'cargo build'` fails.

**Fix**: Always prefix with `source ~/.cargo/env` in SSH commands.

### Pitfall 5: SFTP disabled on US VPS

**Symptom**: `scp` fails to the US VPS.

**Root cause**: OVH US VPS has SFTP subsystem disabled in sshd_config.

**Fix**: Use `cat file | ssh host 'cat > remote_file'` for file transfers to US VPS.

### Pitfall 6: Custody permission denied

**Symptom**: `lichen-custody` fails to start with "Permission denied" on seed files.

**Root cause**: Seed files provisioned as `root:root 600` instead of `root:lichen 640`.

**Fix**: Ensure `/etc/lichen/secrets` is `root:lichen 750` and all files inside are `root:lichen 640`.

### Pitfall 7: Missing LICHEN_KEYPAIR_PASSWORD in custody env

**Symptom**: Custody service can't read the encrypted treasury keypair.

**Root cause**: A provisioning rerun replaced the password in `env-testnet` or
`custody-env`, leaving it inconsistent with the encrypted keypair.

**Fix**: Restore the matching secret. A planned password rotation must
atomically re-encrypt every dependent keypair before any service restarts.

### Pitfall 8: Contract WASM binary mismatch across validators

**Symptom**: Joining validators fail to sync — state root mismatch at genesis block.

**Root cause**: Contracts were rebuilt only on the genesis VPS, producing different WASM hashes than the joining VPSes.

**Fix**: Either (a) rsync pre-built WASM artifacts to all VPSes and never rebuild, or (b) run `./scripts/build-all-contracts.sh` on ALL VPSes before genesis. Verify the bundle hash matches:

```bash
command find /var/lib/lichen/contracts -maxdepth 2 -name '*.wasm' | sort | xargs shasum -a 256 | shasum -a 256
```

### Pitfall 9: Full root filesystem makes RPC stale

**Symptom**: One VPS is online at the process level but serves an old slot, public RPC intermittently returns stale chain data, and validator logs contain RocksDB write failures with `No space left on device`.

**Root cause**: Old non-live chain-state backup directories and unbounded sudo I/O logs filled `/`. Once RocksDB could not flush writes, the node stopped advancing even though the RPC process still answered some requests.

**Fix**: Remove non-live state backups from the root filesystem, vacuum bounded logs, restart the affected validator, and verify `getHealth` reports `status:"ok"` with `disk.critical:false`.

**Prevention**: Re-apply the audited host baseline on every VPS before a reset
or launch, then complete the "VPS disk and log guardrails" preflight. Do not
route public traffic to a node whose readiness endpoint reports `stale_tip` or
critical disk.

### Pitfall 10: Rolling release leaves validators on different committed tips

**Symptom**: Validators report different latest slots, BFT repeatedly logs `Syncing to exact network tip`, and a node rejects a peer block with `state-root mismatch`.

**Root cause**: A validator signed consensus votes for a block before locally replaying the full proposal against its canonical pre-state. That is not a valid production BFT flow: validators must process the proposal and verify parent hash, validator-set hash, transaction root, fee metadata, and state root before prevoting.

**Fix**: Stop every validator immediately and keep `/var/lib/lichen/state-<net>`,
the cold archive, keys, WAL, and journals intact. Ship a new signed release with
the proposal-validation gate fixed, install it on every validator, and resume
coordinately from each validator's preserved state. Do not reset the current
testnet or replace one validator's state with another's.

**Prevention**: Treat proposal execution before prevote as a release-blocking invariant. A rolling deploy health gate must fail on stale block age, split tips, or state-root mismatch, and operators must not heal by copying another validator's RocksDB directory.

### Pitfall 11: Rolling release installs a new binary but keeps an old process alive

**Symptom**: `/usr/local/bin/lichen-validator` has the new release hash, but one validator still serves behavior from the previous release. `systemctl status` shows an old `ExecMainStartTimestamp`, and `/proc/<pid>/exe` points at `/usr/local/bin/lichen-validator (deleted)` with the old executable hash.

**Root cause**: The release archive was installed on disk, but the validator service did not replace the running process. A health-only rolling gate can pass because the old process still answers RPC.

**Fix**: Stop the affected service, kill the service control group only if it remains active after stop, start it again, and verify `/proc/<pid>/exe` for the main and supervised validator processes hashes to the installed release binary. Do not reset chain state or copy RocksDB state for this service-process issue.

**Prevention**: Rolling deploys must fail unless the service PID/start timestamp changes and all running validator processes in the service execute the expected signed-release hash.

### Pitfall 12: Commit-certificate subsets must not affect state

**Symptom**: A validator accepts a fee-bearing block, then rejects the next block with `state-root mismatch`. The rejected next block may be an empty liveness block because it only exposes the state divergence from the previous committed block.

**Root cause**: Post-block fee distribution used the locally observed `commit_signatures` subset as an input to account balances. That subset is finality evidence, not canonical block state: validators are allowed to commit as soon as they observe any valid two-thirds supermajority, so different validators can persist different signature subsets for the same block.

**Fix**: Ship a validator release that derives all fee-recipient state from canonical block data plus the active stake pool, with deterministic ordering. Do not copy RocksDB state between validators to hide the divergence.

**Prevention**: No state-root-affecting path may depend on local vote aggregators, locally collected prevotes/precommits, commit-certificate subset size/order, wall-clock arrival order, RPC routing, or other observer-local evidence. Release tests must include "same block, different commit-signature subsets, same state root" coverage for any post-block accounting path.

### Pitfall 13: Stale Caddy ingress breaks WebSocket intermittently

**Symptom**: HTTPS JSON-RPC is healthy, but `wss://testnet-rpc.lichen.network/ws` intermittently hangs or fails to subscribe.

**Root cause**: The origin Caddyfile drifted from the checked-in repo-managed ingress and still proxied `/ws` to another validator's raw `:8900` listener. Raw RPC/WS ports are intentionally not public ingress, so cross-origin proxy attempts can hang even while each validator is locally healthy.

**Fix**: Recompose Caddy from the exact signed release fragments with approved
host-local origin-auth provisioning, run `caddy validate`, install atomically,
and reload Caddy. Do not reset validator state.

**Prevention**: Treat Caddy as deployment state, not hand-edited host state. After every reset or launch, compare `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` against `deploy/Caddyfile.common` plus the network fragment and run the public `subscribeSlots` WebSocket smoke test 10/10.

### Pitfall 14: Dedicated WS hostname bypasses edge TLS

**Symptom**: `wss://testnet-rpc.lichen.network/ws` works, but `wss://testnet-ws.lichen.network` or `wss://ws.lichen.network` fails with an untrusted certificate.

**Root cause**: The dedicated WS hostname resolves directly to validator VPS IPs while the checked-in Caddy config uses `tls internal` for Cloudflare-origin traffic. Public clients then see the origin-only certificate instead of the trusted edge certificate.

**Fix**: Prefer the RPC-hosted WS endpoint (`wss://testnet-rpc.lichen.network/ws` or `wss://rpc.lichen.network/ws`) in clients. If the dedicated hostname is still advertised, proxy it through the trusted edge or switch that origin hostname to a public CA certificate, then rerun the WSS smoke test.

**Prevention**: DNS and TLS are part of the release gate. For every advertised WSS hostname, `dig +short` must show the intended edge path when `tls internal` is used, and `websocat -n1 <url>` must pass from outside the VPS network.

### Pitfall 15: Native oracle consensus remains at genesis while ticker moves

**Symptom**: DEX pair prices move through `ticker:<pair_id>` WebSocket updates, but `/api/v1/oracle/prices` shows wrapped assets at `slot:0` with `stale:true`, and `/api/v1/pairs/<id>/candles?interval=60` keeps returning flat genesis-price candles after a reset.

**Root cause**: Oracle attestation transactions are included in blocks, but committed replay failed to persist opcode-30 oracle attestation side effects. The live ticker path can still move because it broadcasts from the validator's local market feed, while DEX candles are written from committed native consensus oracle prices.

**Fix**: Ship a validator release that persists oracle attestation and consensus-price side effects exactly once after the canonical committed transaction batch, then restart through the runbook. Do not patch the DEX frontend, synthesize candles, or seed fake history.

**Prevention**: After every reset, launch, or rolling release, run the Step 8 DEX oracle/candle smoke. The gate must prove that wrapped-asset native consensus oracle slots advance past genesis and that 1m candles are present through the same public RPC path used by browsers.

### Pitfall 16: All validators restart at the same stale tip and never re-enter BFT

**Symptom**: Every validator service is `active`, all nodes report the same stale slot through `getHealth`, public RPC methods such as `getSlot` return `RPC node is not ready`, and browser apps or the explorer show 503/readiness failures.

**Root cause**: Restarted validators use the pre-consensus peer-tip gate before re-entering BFT. That gate must be able to observe peer tips even when the whole cluster is stale. If it asks peers only through readiness-gated methods such as `getSlot`, every peer can reject the query as not ready, leaving all validators waiting for peer-tip observation at the same height.

**Fix**: Ship a validator release where bootstrap tip discovery falls back to the `getHealth` slot when `getSlot` is readiness-gated, then roll the signed release without flushing state. Do not copy RocksDB state, delete validator identities, synthesize blocks, or bypass BFT.

**Prevention**: Rolling-release and restart drills must include a same-tip stale-cluster restart check. The expected behavior is: services resume existing state, observe peer slots through health, catch up if peers are ahead, and enter BFT when local slot equals the observed network tip.

### Pitfall 17: Public RPC account history is missing after a valid snapshot rejoin

**Symptom**: `getHealth`, balances, staking state, and consensus all look correct, but wallet/extension activity, explorer account history, `getTransactionsByAddress`, or old `getBlock`/`getTransaction` lookups return empty data for historical accounts.

**Root cause**: Account transaction rows, historical block bodies, transaction-by-slot rows, and archive account snapshots are RPC/archive data. They are not part of the state root. A validator can be consensus-valid from a checkpoint snapshot while still lacking old public-history backing rows if it was started as a state-only node or imported a snapshot without backed archive history.

**Current release gate**: Archive parity is mandatory for public testnet
readiness. Follow
[`ARCHIVE_PARITY_REPAIR_PLAN_2026-07-09.md`](ARCHIVE_PARITY_REPAIR_PLAN_2026-07-09.md)
before any live rollout. The fix is to replicate and verify backed public
history into every validator, not to delete the richest source until the fleet
looks uniform.

**Preferred parity commands**: Use the canonical public-history manifest and
repair commands for new releases. They scan hot plus cold stores, include block,
transaction, account-history, event, token-transfer, program-call, trade, market,
NFT, EVM, shielded, and account-snapshot public categories, and emit JSON
evidence.

Same-key mismatches remain fatal except for a typed completion of an existing
header-only block. That completion requires an exact key/hash and canonical
header match, a valid recomputed transaction root, and identical oracle payload;
it preserves the target validator's local finality certificate. Require the
expected `upgraded_incomplete_rows` count in dry-run evidence and zero other
conflicts. The fleet repair helper uses binary framed streams and persistent SSH
controls for every category.

Bulk archive bytes must remain outside the `sudo` I/O-audit boundary. The
helper starts an unprivileged `lichen` child whose internal pipeline performs
export plus compression, and another whose internal pipeline performs
decompression plus import. Only the bounded import report returns through the
privileged session. Do not rewrite this as `sudo ... | gzip`, `gzip -dc | sudo
...`, or as a page streamed on `sudo` stdin: hosts with `log_input` or
`log_output` will duplicate the payload under `/var/log/sudo-io` and can fill
the validator disk without changing canonical history.

Use the `run_validator_admin` wrapper from the VPS preflight for every direct
archive command. The current interactive `sudo` path can otherwise inherit a
1,024-descriptor limit. The fleet verifier sets the hard/soft limit with root
`prlimit`, drops identity with `setpriv` without reapplying the PAM ceiling, and
fails with status 98 unless both effective limits equal the requested value.
Do not move the limit change after `sudo -u lichen` or make the effective-limit
check best-effort.

A live RocksDB secondary manifest is diagnostic only. The secondary opens SSTs
lazily, so a long scan can encounter files replaced by primary compaction and
produce an apparent historical hole. A release proof requires one deterministic
common tip, every real validator service inactive, and an immutable hot+cold
checkpoint per validator. On the current 200 GB VPS roots, keep the validators
stopped while those checkpoints are scanned: restarting a live writer pins
compaction replacements behind the checkpoint hard links. Preserve accepted
reports, remove the checkpoints, and only then perform the coordinated start.
The exact operational record is in
[`ARCHIVE_V2_SEGMENTED_STORAGE_PLAN_2026-07-21.md`](ARCHIVE_V2_SEGMENTED_STORAGE_PLAN_2026-07-21.md#23-deterministic-fixed-tip-parity-recovery-2026-07-22).

Before executing repair, prove that at least one verified source contains each
historical slot from genesis to tip. If every live validator returns
`Block not found` for a slot range, that is a backed-source gap, not a parity
state. Do not "fix" parity by making every validator equally incomplete. Either
find the real backup/archive source for the missing range and repair from it, or
keep the release blocked. For the current July testnet incident, reset, new
genesis, block synthesis, and state replacement are prohibited.

**Fix**: Restore only from a real backed source. First prove the source before rebuilding:

```bash
run_validator_admin /usr/local/bin/lichen-validator \
  --network testnet \
  --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet \
  --secondary-dir /tmp/lichen-account-history-check \
  --cache-size-mb 256 \
  --rebuild-account-txs \
  --source parent-chain \
  --dry-run

run_validator_admin /usr/local/bin/lichen-validator \
  --network testnet \
  --db-path /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet \
  --secondary-dir /tmp/lichen-account-history-check \
  --cache-size-mb 256 \
  --rebuild-account-txs \
  --source tx-index \
  --dry-run
```

For a genesis-complete archive source, the parent-chain dry-run must report that
it reached genesis and `source_complete=true`; the tx-index dry-run must include
the expected historical rows for the affected accounts. If no real block,
transaction, archive, or off-host backup source contains the old rows, do not
synthesize activity from balances or current state.

When a verified source exists, merge only public archive/history data into the
target node. Do not replace live RocksDB, copy consensus/account state, or write
contract storage from the backup:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop lichen-validator-testnet

run_validator_admin /usr/local/bin/lichen-validator \
  --network testnet \

# cold/archive DB, include this same read-only flag on dry-run and execute so
# the merge scans both source layers:

```

The broad merge command writes large historical blocks, transactions, account
history, token transfers, contract events, and program-call rows into the
attached cold store, and writes only small slot/tx ordering indexes into the hot
DB. The index-only merge intentionally skips block bodies and slot cursors and
imports only backed public-history indexes and transaction records. Both modes
are additive: existing current rows stay in place, rows created after the backup
are not deleted, and any same-key byte mismatch in the selected column families
is reported as a conflict and aborts the execute path. They clear cached `atxc:`
counters after a successful write so RPC counts are reseeded from the restored
rows, and leave consensus state column
families such as accounts, balances, validators, stake pools, MossStake,
contract storage, Merkle nodes, and shielded pool state untouched.

For archive/public RPC nodes, do not place the node back behind wallet,
explorer, or monitoring traffic until both checks pass:

```bash
curl -fsS -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getTransactionsByAddress","params":["<known historical address>",30]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8899 | jq '.result.transactions | length'

curl -fsS -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8899 | jq '.result'
```

**Prevention**: Every public RPC validator must run with:

```text
LICHEN_EXTRA_ARGS=--auto-update=off
```

The systemd unit must expand `$LICHEN_EXTRA_ARGS`, not `${LICHEN_EXTRA_ARGS}`,
so current non-archive options remain separate argv entries. Starting with
`v0.5.224`, public archive mode and the canonical sibling cold-store path are
runtime invariants rather than operator flags. Keep
`/var/lib/lichen/archive-<network>` on monitored storage and include archive
history checks in release and rejoin drills before declaring wallet/explorer
activity green.

### Pitfall 18: TOFU identity prevents rejoining after state wipe

**Symptom**: Wiped validator responds on RPC but stays at slot 0. P2P connections from other validators close immediately: `Failed to accept stream: closed by peer: 0`.

**Root cause**: The wiped validator generates a new keypair and P2P identity. Other validators have the old identity cached in their TOFU (Trust On First Use) store at `data/state-<port>/home/.lichen/peer_identities.json`. The TOFU check rejects the new identity as an impostor.

Also, the wiped validator's new pubkey registers as a separate entry in the validator set. With N+1 validators and only N-1 online (original minus the ghost), BFT quorum (2/3+) may be unreachable.

**Current release behavior**: `v0.5.240` is the signed testnet release target and
`v0.5.225` is the preserved signed pre-change binary, not a restartable
rollback. It preserves the recovery and storage safeguards established by
`v0.5.229` and adds the signed Archive V2 retrofit gates. The earlier release fixes the inclusive
initial post-effects recovery boundary and retains the exact-testnet 5 GiB
runtime reserve plus the 50,000-slot default hot-history window; mainnet and
unclassified production retain the 10 GiB reserve, and all backed historical
data remains available through hot/cold reads. It also supersedes the
v0.5.227-only legacy replay-drift repair command, whose dry run fails closed
before writing because it conflates bonded validator total and spendable
balances. v0.5.228 validates those fields independently and requires the exact
child-certified projected root. v0.5.229 additionally normalizes only the six
exact chain-, slot-, key-, and value-hash-bound account snapshot before images
for public-history reads while preserving the raw US rows as provenance; the
six repair-slot rows are added to the other validators without deletion or
overwrite. It also removes the independent 95%-used RPC readiness threshold so
the temporary explicit 5 GiB testnet reserve is not silently raised to roughly
10.35 GiB on the current VPS roots; disk percentage remains visible as
telemetry and the validator runtime keeps the 10 GiB reserve outside exact
testnet. Finally, the exact five SEA-sourced `tx_meta` rows at legacy incomplete
slot `5,276,000` are imported additively into US/EU/IN only after signed dry
runs show five inserts and zero conflicts; no block, transaction, state, WAL,
key, identity, or existing history row is overwritten. v0.5.226 was superseded before deployment
because it contains the storage bridge but not the restart fix.
State-repair snapshots carry consensus state and complete public-history
categories, while public-history repair remains additive, source-backed,
conflict-checked, and never replaces validator identity, consensus WAL, or
mutable chain state. Snapshot completion requires the target slot/root and a
complete genesis-to-target public-history proof. Interrupted apply restores
every exact pre-apply hot category from the local rollback profile, preserves
the independent cold archive, persists the recovered checkpoint, and removes
the marker last. Startup preserves any validator with real chain progress or an
attached cold archive. BFT restart rounds come only from durable signed WAL or
authenticated peer votes, never stale wall-clock age. Existing public chains
must be stopped at an exact common tip and prepared with one guarded, WAL-synced
`tip + 1` activation slot; absent preparation exits 78. Block-hash-bound
producer and comprehensive markers are audited only inside the
activated bounded recent window; pre-activation marker absence is never replay
evidence, and analytics v2 waits for the same boundary. The pre-BFT parent gate
completes an activated stale canonical parent before the next height reads
state. Candidate blocks after height 1 commit the parent
finality certificate, complete sorted parent-height voting powers, parent
post-effects state root, and exact child fee/oracle metadata in a version-2
consensus transaction. Canonical execution state, receipts, block anchor,
transaction slot indexes, and tip/finality cursors commit in one RocksDB batch.
Proposal validation, sync ingestion, checkpoint verification, mainnet startup,
and RPC serving verify the parent proof independently; mainnet fails closed if
any envelope, body, inclusion proof, authenticated powers, state root, or
two-thirds threshold is missing.

**Fix for local dev**: Remove the wiped validator's entry from all other validators' TOFU stores, then restart all validators from scratch:

```bash
# Remove stale TOFU entries (example: V2 on port 7002 was wiped)
python3 -c "
import json
for v in ['state-7001', 'state-7003']:
    path = f'data/{v}/home/.lichen/peer_identities.json'
    with open(path) as f:
        d = json.load(f)
    if '127.0.0.1:7002' in d:
        del d['127.0.0.1:7002']
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(d, f, indent=2)
```

**Prevention**: The wipe example is permitted only for a disposable local
development chain. Never apply it to testnet, staging, or mainnet. Public
validator recovery must preserve that validator's own keypair, node identity,
state, hot/cold history, and consensus WAL and use verified network sync or the
documented snapshot rollback path. A public-chain reset or fresh genesis is not
an incident-recovery command.

## Nuclear reset procedure

Use this when the validators have diverged beyond recovery (e.g. state root mismatch, stuck consensus, validator identity conflicts).

### Local nuclear reset

```bash
# 1. Stop everything
./lichen-stop.sh all
# Kill any lingering supervisors
pkill -9 -f validator-supervisor
pkill -9 -f lichen-validator

# 2. Wipe all state
rm -rf data/state-7001 data/state-7002 data/state-7003
mkdir -p data/state-7001 data/state-7002 data/state-7003

# 3. Start fresh — V1 creates genesis, then V2 and V3 sync
LICHEN_LOCAL_DEV=1 ./run-validator.sh testnet 1 --dev-mode &
sleep 15  # wait for genesis creation + first blocks
LICHEN_LOCAL_DEV=1 ./run-validator.sh testnet 2 --dev-mode &
LICHEN_LOCAL_DEV=1 ./run-validator.sh testnet 3 --dev-mode &

# 4. Verify all local validators are healthy and at the same slot
sleep 10
for port in 8899 8901 8903; do
  echo "Port $port:"
  curl -s http://localhost:$port -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth","params":[]}'
  echo ""
done
```

### VPS nuclear reset (all validators)

```bash
# 1. Stop services on ALL VPSes
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03 seed-04; do
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network \
    'sudo systemctl stop lichen-validator-testnet lichen-custody lichen-faucet'
done

# 2. Wipe state on ALL VPSes (preserve and verify host-local keypairs!)
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03 seed-04; do
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network '
    PRESERVE="/var/lib/lichen/identity-preserve-state-testnet-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
    sudo install -d -m 700 -o root -g root "$PRESERVE/state-testnet"
    sudo install -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \
      /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json \
      "$PRESERVE/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json"
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lichen/.lichen
    sudo install -d -m 750 -o lichen -g lichen /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet
    sudo install -m 600 -o lichen -g lichen \
      "$PRESERVE/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json" \
      /var/lib/lichen/state-testnet/validator-keypair.json
  '
done

# 3. Recreate genesis on the primary (US) VPS — follow Step 4 from VPS Runbook above

# 4. Run post-genesis deploy on the genesis VPS — follow Step 5

# 5. Copy signed metadata manifest to joining VPSes — follow Step 6

# 6. Start validators on ALL VPSes
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03 seed-04; do
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network \
    'sudo systemctl start lichen-validator-testnet'
done

# 7. Start custody and faucet on genesis VPS
ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@seed-01.lichen.network \
  'sudo systemctl start lichen-custody && sudo systemctl start lichen-faucet'

# 8. Verify all 4 are healthy
for HOST in seed-01 seed-02 seed-03 seed-04; do
  echo "=== $HOST ==="
  ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@$HOST.lichen.network \
    'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"getHealth\",\"params\":[]}"'
  echo ""
done
```

Critical: always preserve `validator-keypair.json` during a nuclear reset. If you lose it, the genesis validator pubkey changes and a completely new genesis is required.

## Cloudflare Pages deployment

All frontend portals are deployed as static sites to Cloudflare Pages via Wrangler.

### Projects

| Portal | Pages project | Directory | Custom domain |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| DEX | `lichen-network-dex` | `dex/` | `dex.lichen.network` |
| Wallet | `lichen-network-wallet` | `wallet/` | `wallet.lichen.network` |
| Explorer | `lichen-network-explorer` | `explorer/` | `explorer.lichen.network` |
| Faucet | `lichen-network-faucet` | `faucet/` | Pages `.pages.dev` domain or a separate portal-only hostname. Do not attach `faucet.lichen.network`; that hostname is the faucet API origin. |
| Marketplace | `lichen-network-marketplace` | `marketplace/` | `marketplace.lichen.network` |
| Developers | `lichen-network-developers` | `developers/` | `developers.lichen.network` |
| Programs | `lichen-network-programs` | `programs/` | `programs.lichen.network` |
| Monitoring | `lichen-network-monitoring` | `monitoring/` | `monitoring.lichen.network` |
| Website | `lichen-network-website` | `website/` | `lichen.network` |

### Deploy verified frontend exports

Deploy from a clean committed checkout after the required CI checks pass for
that exact commit. Do not publish a raw working directory or use
`--commit-dirty=true`. The DEX export includes its retained licensed chart bundle;
the wallet export contains the selected public assets, not extension source or
private release inputs. An all-portal loop is not an export verification gate.

Before each deployment, seal an export manifest with the source commit, complete
file list, byte lengths and SHA-256 hashes. Bind first-party HTML script/style
URLs to the exported asset content so edge caches cannot mix old CSS/JS with new
HTML. Verify the complete export against its manifest, reject symlinks/unlisted
files, and record the current production deployment ID. The exact exporter,
manifest and deployment operator for an active release are recorded in
the per-run deployment record; inspect its current evidence before resuming.

The final Pages command, after those checks, has this form:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
LICHEN_FRONTEND_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
wrangler pages deploy "${LICHEN_FRONTEND_EXPORT_DIR:?verified portal export required}" \
  --project-name "${LICHEN_FRONTEND_PROJECT:?exact Pages project required}" \
  --branch main \
  --commit-hash "$LICHEN_FRONTEND_COMMIT" \
  --commit-dirty=false
```

Set the project and export directory from the sealed release record. Retain an
intent before invoking Pages and a deployment receipt afterward. If a command
disconnects, inspect the recorded attempt and remote deployment list before
retrying. Verify the resulting production branch and source commit, then hash
all served assets on both the immutable deployment URL and custom domain using
the actual content-versioned URLs in HTML. An unversioned edge-cache response
alone does not establish whether the newly deployed page loads the correct file.

Wrangler prioritizes `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` over its saved OAuth session. An R2
Account token may lack Pages permissions. Verify the exact project with a
read-only deployment listing using the intended credential. When the existing
Pages OAuth session is the qualified credential, omit that environment variable
for the Pages command only; preserve R2 credentials and never print their values.

### Wallet PWA and Activity acceptance

For a wallet deployment, run `npm run test-wallet`,
`npm run test-wallet-extension`, `npm run test-wallet-browser`, and
`npm run test-frontend-assets`, with the SDK built as required by the audit.
The browser gate covers web/extension layouts and popup sessions; it must also
exercise actual service-worker installation, cache migration, cached offline
assets, uncached network failures, offline navigation and fresh faucet activity.
Repeat public browser acceptance against the deployed assets. Keep `sw.js` and
HTML revalidated through their configured response headers and increment the
worker cache version for changed cached assets or worker behavior.

Every `respondWith` promise must resolve to a `Response` or reject. A failed
network request with no cached copy must not resolve to `undefined`; that emits
`Failed to convert value to 'Response'`. Dynamic RPC/API and faucet activity
requests must bypass the static asset cache. A worker fix does not prove a
separate RPC performance problem is resolved.

When Activity loads slowly, record its `getTransactionsByAddress` request
duration, any faucet request duration, and the time rows render. Distinguish
synthetic browser fixtures from live account timing. Check the installed/running
validator release and whether a known canonical-slot receipt lookup accesses
only its authenticated archive segment. Do not attribute a slow request to
hot/cold storage solely because Archive V2 is enabled, and do not backfill or
change account history without source-backed evidence.

### Shared configuration

All portals share `shared-config.js` which defines RPC endpoints, WebSocket URLs, and cross-portal links. When updating this file:

1. Edit the canonical copy in `dex/shared-config.js`
2. Copy to all other portals:

```bash
for dir in wallet explorer faucet marketplace developers programs monitoring website; do
  cp dex/shared-config.js "$dir/shared-config.js"
done
```

3. Verify all copies are identical:

```bash
shasum dex/shared-config.js wallet/shared-config.js explorer/shared-config.js \
  faucet/shared-config.js marketplace/shared-config.js developers/shared-config.js \
  programs/shared-config.js monitoring/shared-config.js website/shared-config.js
```

4. Produce and verify a separate export for each affected portal, deploy it through
   the procedure above, then verify its served assets.

### Custom domains

Custom domains are managed in the Cloudflare Dashboard, not via Wrangler:

1. Go to Pages > project > Custom domains
2. Add the domain (e.g. `dex.lichen.network`)
3. Cloudflare auto-creates a CNAME record if DNS is managed by Cloudflare

Do not add `faucet.lichen.network` as a Cloudflare Pages custom domain. That
hostname must stay routed to the Caddy origin serving the Rust faucet API on
port 9100. If a human-facing faucet portal hostname is needed, use a separate
name and keep `faucet/shared-config.js` pointing API calls at
`https://faucet.lichen.network`.

### Faucet architecture

The faucet has two separate components served on different domains:

- **`lichen-network-faucet.pages.dev`** (Cloudflare Pages): Static faucet portal (HTML/JS/CSS). This is the user-facing page.
- **`faucet.lichen.network`** (Cloudflare → Caddy → VPS port 9100): Faucet Rust/axum API service. This is the backend that dispenses LICN.

The static portal calls the API at `https://faucet.lichen.network/faucet/request`. This works because:

1. `shared-config.js` sets `faucet: 'https://faucet.lichen.network'` in production
2. `faucet.js` reads `LICHEN_CONFIG.faucet` as `FAUCET_API`
3. DNS for `faucet.lichen.network` routes through Cloudflare to the active seed-origin fleet
4. Caddy (`deploy/Caddyfile.testnet`) reverse proxies faucet API traffic to `127.0.0.1:9100` on each active origin
5. The faucet-service CORS layer allows `https://faucet.lichen.network` and all portal origins

The faucet service only serves API endpoints (`/health`, `/faucet/config`, `/faucet/status`, `/faucet/airdrops`, `/faucet/request`). It does NOT serve static HTML — that comes from Cloudflare Pages.

Do NOT confuse the `faucet` key in `shared-config.js` with a portal URL — it is the API endpoint. The faucet portal is accessed via the Pages `.pages.dev` domain or a separate portal-only custom domain added to the Pages project.

## Incident Log

### 2026-04-09: Treasury keypair missing on seed-02/seed-03

**Symptom:** RPC `requestAirdrop` calls routed via Cloudflare round-robin intermittently failed with `"Treasury keypair not configured"`. DEX and marketplace tests on VPS showed 0 orders/trades because wallets only had ~20 LICN (genesis allocation) and could not fund contract operations.

**Root cause:** The `genesis-wallet.json` and `genesis-keys/` directory (containing the treasury keypair) are local artifacts created ONLY on the genesis VPS during genesis creation. They are NOT part of the blockchain state that syncs via P2P. The deployment pipeline had no step to distribute these files to joining VPSes. Seed-02 and seed-03 had empty `genesis-keys/` directories and no `genesis-wallet.json`, causing `load_treasury_keypair()` to return `None`.

**Superseded fix:** That incident was initially handled by copying genesis keys to all validators. That is no longer the production model. Joining validators must not need, receive, or rely on genesis wallet material. Faucet/custody service hosts may receive service-specific keys, but validator chain sync and consensus membership must work from the validator's own identity key plus `seeds.json`.

**Prevention:** Keep airdrop/faucet routing service-aware instead of treating every validator RPC as a treasury signer. External validators and independent joiner VPSes should report `"Treasury keypair not configured"` for raw `requestAirdrop` unless they intentionally run a faucet/treasury service.

## 1. Executive Summary

PredictionMoss brings Polymarket-class prediction markets to Lichen as a first-party DEX feature — not a separate platform. Users trade outcome shares (YES/NO or multi-outcome) on real-world events, with prices reflecting live probabilities. Settlement in lUSD (the DEX quote currency), liquidity via an integrated AMM, and resolution through LichenOracle's attestation + VRF systems.

### Why This Matters

- **Prediction markets are the highest-engagement DeFi product** — Polymarket hit $1B+ monthly volume in 2024
- **Agent-first vision** — AI agents can programmatically trade on real-world events using data models, creating deep liquidity
- **Completes the DEX** — Lichen DEX gets a "Predict" tab alongside Trade, Swap, Pool, and Earn
- **Leverages existing infrastructure** — LichenOracle for resolution, dex_analytics for charting, lUSD for settlement, LichenID for reputation-gated market creation

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Settlement currency | **lUSD** | Consistent with DEX, stablecoin-denominated, $1.00 = 1 full share |
| AMM type | **Binary CPMM** (x·y=k) for 2-outcome; **Scalar CPMM** for multi | Simple, proven, gas-efficient |
| Resolution | **LichenOracle attestation** (multi-sig threshold) | Decentralized, already deployed, supports VRF |
| Share representation | **Contract storage balances** (not separate tokens) | No need for ERC-1155; Lichen uses account-level balances |
| Market creation | **Reputation-gated** (500+ LichenID rep) | Anti-spam, quality control, no separate governance vote needed |
| Dispute resolution | **Challenge period + bond + DAO escalation** | Prevents bad resolutions without blocking fast settlement |
| CLOB integration | **Optional** — AMM primary, CLOB for deep markets | Most markets use AMM; high-volume markets can also list on dex_core |

---

## 2. How Polymarket Works (Reference Architecture)

Understanding Polymarket's design to match and exceed it:

### Core Mechanics

1. **Conditional Tokens**: Every market creates YES and NO tokens (or multiple outcome tokens). Each full set of outcome tokens is backed by $1.00 USDC collateral.

2. **Minting**: A user deposits $1.00 USDC → receives 1 YES token + 1 NO token. This is the "mint" operation. The collateral is locked.

3. **Trading**: Users buy/sell outcome tokens on a CLOB (limit order book). Polymarket uses an off-chain orderbook with on-chain settlement (hybrid model).

4. **Pricing**: If YES trades at $0.65, the market implies a 65% probability. YES + NO always sum to $1.00 on the books (arbitrage enforces this).

5. **Resolution**: An oracle (Polymarket uses UMA's optimistic oracle) declares the outcome. Challenge period allows disputes.

6. **Redemption**: After resolution, winning shares are redeemed at $1.00 each. Losing shares are worthless. Collateral is distributed pro-rata.

### What We Keep

- Full collateralization (YES + NO backed by lUSD)
- Shares priced 0.00–1.00 lUSD
- Minting/redeeming share sets
- Resolution with dispute period
- Limit order trading for deep markets

### What We Improve

| Polymarket Limitation | PredictionMoss Solution |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Off-chain orderbook (centralized matching) | Fully on-chain CPMM + optional CLOB |
| UMA oracle (single provider, slow disputes) | LichenOracle multi-sig attestation (threshold-based, faster) |
| No built-in AMM (relies on market makers) | Integrated CPMM ensures always-on liquidity |
| Separate platform from DEX | Integrated as a DEX tab — same wallet, same UI |
| No agent API | First-class agent support with LichenID integration |
| ERC-1155 tokens (complex) | Simple balance storage (cheaper, faster) |
| External dispute resolution | On-chain DAO escalation via LichenDAO |

## 3. PredictionMoss Architecture

### Single Contract Design

One contract — `prediction_market` — handles everything:
- Market creation and configuration
- Share minting and redemption
- Integrated CPMM AMM for each market
- Resolution and settlement
- Dispute handling

**Why single contract?** Cross-contract calls are stubs on Lichen (return 0). Multi-contract designs would require multi-step transactions. A single contract keeps all state atomic and consistent.

### Market States

```
PENDING    → Market created, accepting initial liquidity (before trading opens)
ACTIVE     → Trading open, AMM active
CLOSED     → Trading closed (time expired), awaiting resolution
RESOLVING  → Resolution submitted, in dispute period
RESOLVED   → Final — winning outcome determined, redemptions enabled
DISPUTED   → Resolution challenged, escalated to DAO vote or re-attestation
VOIDED     → Market cancelled — all collateral returned at original mint ratios
```

State transitions:
```
PENDING ──(add_initial_liquidity)──► ACTIVE
ACTIVE  ──(close_time reached)────► CLOSED
ACTIVE  ──(emergency_void)────────► VOIDED
CLOSED  ──(submit_resolution)─────► RESOLVING

## 5. AMM Design — Binary CPMM

### Constant Product Market Maker

For binary markets (YES/NO), we use x·y=k where:
- `x` = virtual reserve of YES tokens in the pool
- `y` = virtual reserve of NO tokens in the pool
- `k` = x·y (invariant, increases with liquidity additions)

**Price derivation:**
```
price_YES = y / (x + y)
price_NO  = x / (x + y)
price_YES + price_NO = 1.00  (always, by construction)
```

**Example:** If pool has 1000 YES and 1000 NO reserves:
- price_YES = 1000 / 2000 = $0.50 (50% probability)
- price_NO  = 1000 / 2000 = $0.50

After someone buys 100 YES shares for lUSD:
```
New x (YES reserve) decreases, y (NO reserve) stays or increases
Buying YES → price_YES increases (more likely)
```

### Buy Operation (buy_shares)

```
Input: market_id, outcome, amount_musd
1. Mint a virtual complete set: amount_musd → (1 YES + 1 NO) * amount
2. Sell unwanted outcome shares into pool
3. Net result: user receives shares of desired outcome
4. Pool absorbs opposite outcome shares, adjusting prices

Detailed math:
  shares_per_set = amount_musd / 1_000_000  (1 lUSD = 1 complete set)
  
  // User wants outcome A. We sell outcome B shares into pool.
  b_shares_to_sell = shares_per_set
  
  // CPMM: selling B shares into pool, receiving A shares out
  // x * y = k
  // new_y = y + b_shares_to_sell
  // new_x = k / new_y
  // a_shares_received = x - new_x
  
  a_shares_received = x * b_shares_to_sell / (y + b_shares_to_sell)
  
  // Total shares user gets: shares_per_set (from mint) + a_shares_received (from swap)
  total_shares = shares_per_set + a_shares_received
  
  // Fee: deducted from a_shares_received
  fee_shares = a_shares_received * TRADING_FEE_BPS / 10_000
  actual_shares = total_shares - fee_shares
```

### Sell Operation (sell_shares)

```
Input: market_id, outcome, shares_amount
1. Sell outcome shares into pool for opposite outcome shares
2. Burn complete sets (1 YES + 1 NO) → 1 lUSD
3. Return lUSD to user

Math:
  // Selling A shares into pool for B shares
  b_received = y * shares_to_sell / (x + shares_to_sell)
  
  // Burn min(shares_remaining, b_received) complete sets
  sets_to_burn = min(a_shares_remaining_after_swap, b_received)
  musd_returned = sets_to_burn * 1_000_000
  
  fee = musd_returned * TRADING_FEE_BPS / 10_000
  net_payout = musd_returned - fee
```

### Mint Complete Set

```
Input: market_id, amount_musd
1. Lock amount_musd as collateral
2. Mint `amount` shares of EVERY outcome (1 YES + 1 NO for binary)
3. User holds a hedged position (worth exactly amount_musd before fees)
```

### Redeem Complete Set

```
Input: market_id, amount
1. Burn `amount` shares of EVERY outcome
2. Return `amount * 1_000_000` lUSD (collateral release)
3. Zero-fee operation (no price impact, pure collateral unlock)
```

### Initial Liquidity Provision

Market creator provides initial liquidity:
```
Input: market_id, musd_amount, initial_odds (optional)
1. Mint shares: musd_amount → N complete sets
2. Initialize pool reserves based on initial_odds
   Default (50/50): x = N, y = N → k = N²
   Custom (e.g., 70/30): x = N * 0.3, y = N * 0.7  (more YES expected)
3. Creator receives LP tokens proportional to liquidity
```

---

## 6. Multi-Outcome Markets

For markets with 3-8 outcomes (e.g., "Who wins the election?" with 5 candidates), we extend CPMM:

### Scalar CPMM (Product of reserves)

```
k = r₁ * r₂ * r₃ * ... * rₙ
price_i = (product of all OTHER reserves) / (sum of all such products)
```

Simplified: for N outcomes, each outcome's probability is:
```
price_i = (1 / reserve_i) / sum(1 / reserve_j for all j)
```

All prices sum to 1.00 by construction.

### Trade Math (Multi-Outcome)

Buying outcome i:
```
1. Mint 1 complete set per lUSD deposited (all N outcome shares)
2. Sell all non-desired outcome shares into pool
3. For each non-desired outcome j:
   shares_received_i += reserve_i * shares_j_sold / (reserve_j + shares_j_sold)
```

This is more gas-intensive but capped at 8 outcomes max.

---

## 7. Resolution via LichenOracle

### Resolution Flow

```
1. MARKET CLOSES (close_slot reached)
   Trading stops, AMM frozen

2. RESOLUTION SUBMISSION (anyone with 1000+ reputation)
   - Resolver calls submit_resolution(market_id, winning_outcome, attestation_hash)
   - Posts a bond (100 lUSD) — slashed if resolution is successfully challenged
   - Resolution references a LichenOracle attestation (multi-sig evidence hash)
   
3. ORACLE VERIFICATION
   - Contract reads LichenOracle attestation via storage key
   - Verifies attestation has >= 3 signatories (RESOLUTION_THRESHOLD)
   - Verifies attestation data_hash matches the market's question + outcome
   
4. DISPUTE PERIOD (48 hours)
   - Anyone can call challenge_resolution(market_id, evidence_hash, bond)
   - Challenger posts 100 lUSD bond
   - Market enters DISPUTED state
   
5a. NO DISPUTE → RESOLVED
   - After 48h, resolution is finalized
   - Resolver gets their bond back + 0.5% resolution reward
   - Winning shares redeemable at $1.00 each
   
5b. DISPUTE → DAO ESCALATION
   - LichenDAO governance vote (72h voting period)
   - Options: CONFIRM original resolution | OVERRIDE with different outcome | VOID market
   - Losing party's bond is distributed: 50% to winner, 50% to DAO treasury
```

### Oracle Attestation Format

LichenOracle's existing `submit_attestation()` and `verify_attestation()` are reused:

```
Attestation data layout for prediction market resolution:
  Bytes 0..8    : market_id (u64 LE)
  Byte  8       : winning_outcome (u8)
  Bytes 9..17   : timestamp (u64 LE) — event occurrence time
  Bytes 17..49  : evidence_hash (32 bytes) — SHA-256 of evidence URL/document
```

Multiple independent oracles (3+ required) submit attestations with the same data_hash. When threshold is met, the market can accept the resolution.

### Resolution Types

| Type | Resolution Method | Example |
|------|------------------|---------|
| Binary (YES/NO) | Oracle attestation | "Will BTC hit $100K by March?" |
| Multi-outcome | Oracle attestation | "Which AI model wins benchmark X?" |
| Price-based | LichenOracle price feed | "ETH price > $5000 on March 1?" |
| VRF-based | LichenOracle commit-reveal | "What color is drawn in lottery round 42?" |
| Time-based | Automatic at close_slot | "Total LICN burned by end of epoch?" (on-chain data) |

---

## 8. Settlement & Payout

### Redemption After Resolution

```
redeem_shares(market_id, outcome)
1. Verify market status == RESOLVED
2. If outcome == winning_outcome:
     payout = user_shares * 1_000_000  (each share = 1 lUSD)
     credit lUSD to user balance
3. If outcome != winning_outcome:
     payout = 0 (shares worthless)
4. Clear user's position for this market/outcome
```

### Voided Market Refund

```
reclaim_collateral(market_id)
1. Verify market status == VOIDED
2. Calculate user's total cost basis across all outcomes
3. Refund pro-rata based on cost_basis / total_collateral
4. Clear all positions
```

### LP Withdrawal

```
withdraw_liquidity(market_id, lp_shares)
1. Can only withdraw from ACTIVE markets (not CLOSED/RESOLVED)
2. Calculate proportional share of pool reserves
3. Return lUSD collateral minus pool imbalance
4. Burn LP shares
```

---

## 9. Market Lifecycle

### Complete Lifecycle Example

```
Day 0: Creator with 500+ reputation creates market
        "Will SOL reach $250 by March 31, 2026?"
        Duration: 45 days
        Category: Crypto
        Initial liquidity: 500 lUSD (50/50 odds)
        Creation fee: 10 lUSD
        
        Market state: PENDING → ACTIVE (once liquidity added)

Day 1-44: Trading
        Users buy/sell YES and NO shares
        AMM provides continuous liquidity
        Price fluctuates based on market sentiment
        Analytics track volume, price history, open interest
        
        State: ACTIVE

Day 45: Market closes at end of March 31
        Trading stops, AMM frozen
        
        State: CLOSED

Day 45-52: Resolution window (7 days)
        3+ oracle nodes attest: "SOL did NOT reach $250"
        Resolver (1000+ rep) submits resolution: winning_outcome = NO
        Posts 100 lUSD bond
        
        State: RESOLVING

Day 52-54: Dispute period (48 hours)
        No challenges filed
        
        State: RESOLVING → RESOLVED

Day 54+: Settlement
        YES holders: shares worth $0.00
        NO holders: redeem each share for $1.00 lUSD
        Resolver gets bond back + 0.5% of total collateral
        
        State: RESOLVED (permanent)
```

## 10. Integration with Existing DEX

### Single Platform Architecture

PredictionMoss is NOT a separate app — it's a new tab in the DEX interface:

### Cross-Module Integration Points

| Existing Module | Integration |
|----------------|-------------|
| **dex_analytics** | Track prediction market volume, price candles per market (reuse candle system for outcome share prices) |
| **dex_governance** | DAO dispute resolution votes (new proposal type: RESOLVE_PREDICTION = 4) |
| **dex_rewards** | Trading rewards for prediction market volume (fee mining applies same as DEX trades) |
| **LichenOracle** | Resolution attestations + price feed markets + VRF for lottery-type markets |
| **LichenID** | Reputation gates for market creation (500+) and resolution submission (1000+) |
| **lUSD** | Settlement currency — all collateral, payouts, and fees in lUSD |
| **dex_core** | Optional CLOB listing for high-volume prediction markets (outcome shares as tradeable "tokens") |
| **dex_amm** | NOT used directly — prediction markets have their own AMM (CPMM, simpler than concentrated liquidity) |

### Optional CLOB Integration for Deep Markets

When a prediction market reaches high volume (>10K lUSD), it may benefit from a CLOB:

```
1. Admin/governance calls create_clob_market(prediction_market_id)
2. Creates virtual token pair on dex_core: YES_TOKEN/lUSD
3. Traders can place limit orders for outcome shares
4. AMM continues to operate in parallel (provides baseline liquidity)
5. On resolution, all open CLOB orders are cancelled and settled
```

This is optional and can be added in a later phase.

## 11. Governance & Safety

### Market Creation Controls

| Guard | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Anti-spam | 10 lUSD creation fee + 500 reputation minimum |
| Content moderation | Category system + admin/DAO can flag/delist markets |
| Duplicate prevention | Question hash prevents identical markets |
| Market cap | MAX_OPEN_MARKETS = 10,000 prevents storage bloat |
| Duration limits | Min 1 hour, max 1 year |

### Resolution Safety

| Guard | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Oracle threshold | 3+ independent attestations required |
| Resolver bond | 100 lUSD at risk — slashed for incorrect resolution |
| Challenge mechanism | 48-hour dispute window with bond |
| DAO backstop | LichenDAO can override any resolution |
| Timeout void | Market auto-voids after 30 days if unresolved |
| Emergency halt | Admin pause for critical issues |

### Circuit Breakers

```
- If any single market exceeds 50K lUSD collateral → require admin approval for additional deposits
- If total platform collateral exceeds 1M lUSD → governance review triggered
- If AMM price moves >50% in a single slot → 60-second trading pause per market
- If resolution is challenged 3+ times → auto-escalate to DAO
```

## 12. Agent-First Design

### Why Agents Love Prediction Markets

Prediction markets are the most natural DeFi product for AI agents:
- Agents can scrape news, analyze data, build models → trade on probabilities
- API-first interface (no UI needed)
- Markets on everything — crypto, sports, politics, science, tech
- Continuous re-pricing as new information arrives — reward fast data processing

### Agent API Patterns

All operations are WASM callable (opcode dispatch):

```
// Agent creates market based on data analysis
call(opcode=1, creator, category, close_slot, question_hash, outcomes, initial_musd)

// Agent buys shares based on probability model
call(opcode=4, trader, market_id, outcome, amount_musd)

// Agent reads market price (no gas cost in read-only mode)
call(opcode=20, market_id, outcome) → price_in_musd

// Agent can automatically resolve markets via oracle attestation
submit_attestation → submit_resolution flow
```

### Agent Reputation Loop

```
Agent registers identity → Earns reputation via trading → 
Unlocks market creation → Creates quality markets → 
Resolves markets accurately → Earns resolution rewards →
Higher reputation → Access to more features
```

This creates a positive flywheel: better agents create better markets.

## 14. Fee Structure & Economics

### Fee Distribution

| Fee Type | Amount | Distribution |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Market creation | 10 lUSD flat | 100% to protocol treasury |
| AMM trading | 2% of trade value | 50% LPs / 30% protocol / 20% stakers |
| Resolution reward | 0.5% of total collateral | 100% to resolver |
| Dispute bond (loser) | 100 lUSD | 50% to winner / 50% to DAO treasury |
| Mint/redeem complete sets | 0% | No fee (pure collateral lock/unlock) |

### Revenue Projections

At 10% of Polymarket's volume (~$100M/month in peak):
```
Monthly volume: $10M lUSD
Trading fees (2%): $200K lUSD
  → Protocol share (30%): $60K lUSD
  → LP share (50%): $100K lUSD
  → Staker share (20%): $40K lUSD
Creation fees: ~50 markets × 10 lUSD = $500 lUSD
Resolution rewards: ~$50K × 0.5% = $250 lUSD
```

### LP Incentives

Liquidity providers earn:
1. **Trading fees** — 50% of the 2% AMM fee
2. **Resolution bonus** — proportional share of remaining pool excess on resolution
3. **Mining rewards** — via dex_rewards integration (same as DEX LP rewards)

LP risk: impermanent loss if the market resolves to an extreme outcome (all YES or all NO). This is inherent to prediction market LPs.

## 20. Open Questions

### Design Decisions for Discussion

| Question | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Should markets be permissionless or curated? | Permissionless (reputation-gated), Curated (admin-approved), Both | **Reputation-gated** — 500 rep creates, admin can delist |
| CLOB for prediction markets? | Phase 1 (integrated), Phase 2 (later), Never | **Phase 2** — AMM-only first, CLOB for deep markets later |
| Multi-outcome limit? | 2-only, Up to 8, Up to 16 | **Up to 8** — covers most use cases, keeps math tractable |
| Resolution oracle model? | Pure LichenOracle, Specialized oracle set, UMA-style optimistic | **LichenOracle attestation** — already deployed, multi-sig threshold |
| Share representation? | Storage balances, Separate tokens (MT-20), NFTs | **Storage balances** — simplest, cheapest, no cross-contract needed |
| Initial liquidity requirement? | Creator pays all, Platform subsidizes, Community pools | **Creator pays** — skin in the game, deducted from creation fee |

### Deferred Features

| Feature | Reason to Defer |
|---------|----------------|
| CLOB integration for outcome shares | Adds complexity, AMM sufficient for launch |
| Conditional markets (A if B) | Requires chained resolution, complex |
| Scalar markets (range outcomes) | Different AMM math, separate design |
| Leverage on predictions | Requires margin contract integration |
| Market maker incentive program | Needs usage data first |
| Automated resolution bots | Can be built by agents post-launch |

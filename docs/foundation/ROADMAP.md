## Dependencies & Blockers

### Critical Path

```
Month 1: Docs → Core Dev → Local Testnet
                    ↓
Month 2: Multi-Node Testnet → Protocols → SDKs
                    ↓
Month 3: Performance → Bug Fixes → Audit Prep
                    ↓
Month 4: Security Audits → Fix Issues
                    ↓
Month 5: Mainnet Launch → Bootstrap Liquidity
                    ↓
Month 6: Growth & Stability
```

### Current Blockers

1. **Need to recruit founding validators** (0/100 currently)
   - Mitigation: Launch Discord, start outreach
2. **Testnet launch pending** (core development complete, single-node works)
   - Mitigation: Multi-node coordination in progress
3. **No funding secured** (bootstrapping)
   - Mitigation: Launch with founding molty contributions, no VC needed

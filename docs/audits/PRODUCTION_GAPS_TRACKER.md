## 2. DEX WebSocket — Event Emission (Producer Side)

P0-A wired the subscriber side (`subscribeDex`). The producer side now emits
`DexEvent` into `DexEventBroadcaster` when DEX state changes occur.

| # | Feature | REST (working) | WS Channel | Emit Site | Status |
|---|---------|---------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| D1 | Order book updates | `POST /orders` | `orderbook:<pair_id>` | post_order, delete_order | ✅ Done |
| D2 | Trade stream | `POST /router/swap` | `trades:<pair_id>` | post_router_swap | ✅ Done |
| D3 | Price ticker | `POST /router/swap` | `ticker:<pair_id>` | post_router_swap | ✅ Done |
| D4 | OHLCV candles | (emit placeholder) | `candles:<pair_id>:<interval>` | — | ✅ Wired (candle aggregation deferred) |
| D5 | User orders | `POST /orders`, `DELETE /orders/:id` | `orders:<trader_addr>` | post_order, delete_order | ✅ Done |
| D6 | Margin positions | `POST /margin/open`, `POST /margin/close` | `positions:<trader_addr>` | post_margin_open, post_margin_close | ✅ Done |

**Infra**: `dex_broadcaster: Arc<DexEventBroadcaster>` added to RpcState (rpc/src/lib.rs).

## 3. Prediction Market WebSocket

| # | Gap | Status |

| P3 | Emit events from prediction market REST handlers (post_trade, post_create) | ✅ Done |

**Infra**: `prediction_broadcaster: Arc<PredictionEventBroadcaster>` added to RpcState and WsState. Validator start_ws_server call updated.

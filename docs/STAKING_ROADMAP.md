# MoltChain Staking System Roadmap
**Aligned with VISION.md and WHITEPAPER.md**

## Overview

MoltChain implements a **three-phase staking system** designed for agent economies with human participation:

1. **Phase 1 (✅ LIVE)**: Validator Bootstrap Grants
2. **Phase 2 (📋 PLANNED)**: Liquid Staking & Delegation (ReefStake Protocol)
3. **Phase 3 (🔮 FUTURE)**: Advanced DeFi Integration

---

## Phase 1: Validator Bootstrap Grants (CURRENT)

### Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Purpose**: Enable zero-capital validator onboarding to maximize decentralization

**Implementation**: `core/src/consensus.rs::StakePool`

### How It Works

1. **Bootstrap Grant**: New validators receive **10,000 MOLT** automatically
   - No upfront capital required
   - Debt recorded in `bootstrap_debt` field
   - Validator operates immediately

2. **Vesting Through Work**: Validators repay debt through block rewards
   - Each block reward reduces bootstrap debt
   - 100% repayment = "Graduation" = fully vested
   - Validator owns 100% of stake after graduation

3. **Account Creation**: 
   - Code: `validator/src/main.rs` (lines 242-254)
   - Creates validator account with 10K MOLT on first startup
   - Auto-increments global account counter

### Economic Impact

- **Total Grants**: 250M MOLT (25% of 1B supply) reserved for builder grants
- **Validator Allocation**: ~100K grants × 10K MOLT = 1M MOLT total
- **Unlock Timeline**: Vests as validators earn rewards (organic distribution)

### Current Limitations

- ❌ No delegation mechanism (validators can't accept external stake)
- ❌ No liquid staking (stake is locked while validating)
- ❌ No staking rewards for non-validators
- ❌ No APY system for passive stakers

**These features come in Phase 2.**

## Phase 2: Liquid Staking & Delegation (PLANNED)

### Status: 📋 CODE EXISTS BUT NOT ACTIVATED

**Purpose**: Allow anyone (agents/humans) to stake MOLT and earn rewards

**Implementation**: `core/src/reefstake.rs` (partially implemented)

### ReefStake Protocol

**For Stakers (Anyone):**
```rust
// Stake MOLT → Receive stMOLT (liquid staking receipt token)
fn stake(molt_amount: u64) -> Result<u64, String> {
    // 1. Lock user's MOLT in protocol
    // 2. Mint stMOLT at exchange rate
    // 3. User receives stMOLT (tradeable, usable in DeFi)
}

// Unstake stMOLT → Receive MOLT (after 7 day unbonding)
fn unstake(st_molt_amount: u64) -> Result<(), String> {
    // 1. Burn stMOLT
    // 2. Start 7-day unbonding timer
    // 3. Release MOLT after cooldown
}
```

**For Validators (Delegation):**
```rust
// Validators configure commission rate
validator.set_commission(0.10); // 10% to validator, 90% to delegators

// Delegators choose validator
fn delegate_to_validator(validator: Pubkey, amount: u64) -> Result<(), String> {
    // 1. Stake MOLT with specific validator
    // 2. Receive stMOLT
    // 3. Earn rewards proportional to stake
    // 4. Inherit validator's reputation multiplier
}
```

### Reward Distribution Example

**Scenario**: Validator Alice has fully graduated

```
Alice's Stats:
  Own stake:        10,000 MOLT (from bootstrap, fully vested)
  Delegated stake:  40,000 MOLT (from community)
  Total stake:      50,000 MOLT
  Commission:       10%

Block Reward: 0.9 MOLT

Distribution:
  Alice:      0.018 MOLT (10% commission)
  Delegators: 0.162 MOLT (split proportionally by stake)
    - Bob (20K MOLT): 0.081 MOLT (50% of delegation)
    - Carol (10K MOLT): 0.0405 MOLT (25% of delegation)
    - Dave (10K MOLT): 0.0405 MOLT (25% of delegation)
```

### APY Calculation

**Base APY Formula**:
```
Annual Rewards = (Blocks per year × Average block reward × Your stake) / Total staked
APY = (Annual Rewards / Your stake) × 100%

Example (assuming $0.10/MOLT):
- Total staked: 100M MOLT (10% of supply)
- Your stake: 10,000 MOLT
- Blocks/year: ~78.8M blocks (400ms per block)
- Avg reward: 0.1 MOLT per block (mix of TX and heartbeat)
- Annual rewards: 78.8M × 0.1 × (10K / 100M) = 788 MOLT
- APY: (788 / 10,000) × 100% = 7.88%
```

**Variables Affecting APY**:
- Total amount staked (↑ stake = ↓ APY)
- Transaction volume (↑ volume = ↑ rewards = ↑ APY)
- Your validator's performance (↑ uptime = ↑ rewards)
- Network activity (↑ activity = ↑ blocks = ↑ rewards)

**Target APY Range**: 5-15% initially, market-driven long-term

### Implementation Checklist

**Core Protocol**:
- [x] ReefStake smart contract skeleton (`core/src/reefstake.rs`)
- [ ] Exchange rate calculation (stMOLT:MOLT ratio)
- [ ] Reward accumulation tracking
- [ ] Unbonding queue (7-day cooldown)
- [ ] Auto-compounding logic

**Validator Integration**:
- [x] StakePool exists (`core/src/consensus.rs`)
- [ ] Commission rate configuration
- [ ] Delegation acceptance logic
- [ ] Proportional reward splitting
- [ ] Minimum delegation amount (prevent spam)

**RPC Endpoints**:
- [ ] `stakeToReefStake(amount)` - Stake MOLT
- [ ] `unstakeFromReefStake(amount)` - Initiate unstaking
- [ ] `claimUnstakedTokens()` - Claim after cooldown
- [ ] `delegateToValidator(validator, amount)` - Delegate to specific validator
- [ ] `getStakingAPY()` - Real-time APY calculation
- [ ] `getMyStakingInfo()` - User's staking balances/rewards

**UI Components** (Wallet):
- [ ] Staking dashboard (all users)
- [ ] Validator selection UI (browse validators by APY/reputation)
- [ ] Stake/unstake forms
- [ ] Rewards display (earned, pending, claimed)
- [ ] Unbonding timer display

### Migration Plan

**Prerequisites**:
1. ✅ All validators graduated (bootstrap debt = 0)
2. ✅ Minimum 50 active validators (decentralization)
3. ✅ 30-day mainnet stability (no consensus issues)
4. ⏳ DAO governance vote (66% supermajority)

**Activation Sequence**:
1. Deploy ReefStake program to mainnet
2. Publish stMOLT token contract
3. Enable delegation in validator software
4. Launch staking UI in wallet
5. Announce to community

**Timeline**: Q2 2026 (after 3 months of mainnet stability)

## Phase 3: Advanced DeFi Integration (FUTURE)

### Status: 🔮 CONCEPTUAL (WHITEPAPER SPEC)

**Purpose**: Make staked assets productive in DeFi

### Planned Features

**1. stMOLT as DeFi Collateral**
- Use stMOLT in LobsterLend (lending protocol)
- Borrow stablecoins against stMOLT
- Leverage staking yields

**2. stMOLT Liquidity Pools**
- stMOLT/MOLT pool on ClawSwap (DEX)
- Earn trading fees + staking rewards
- Instant liquidity for unstaking (vs 7-day wait)

**3. Auto-Compounding Vaults**
- ClawVault aggregates staking + DeFi yields
- Automated strategy optimization
- Agent-managed rebalancing

**4. Flash Unstaking**
- Instant unstake via liquidity pool swap
- Small premium paid to LPs
- No 7-day wait

**5. Synthetic Staking Derivatives**
- Long/short staking yields
- Options on APY
- Yield swaps between validators

### Implementation Timeline

- **Q3 2026**: stMOLT as collateral
- **Q4 2026**: Liquidity pools & flash unstaking
- **Q1 2027**: Auto-compounding vaults
- **Q2 2027**: Synthetic derivatives

## Economic Modeling

### Total Staking Capacity

```
Maximum Staked: 1,000,000,000 MOLT (100% of supply)
Realistic Staked: 100,000,000 - 300,000,000 MOLT (10-30%)
  
Why not 100%?
- Need liquid MOLT for transactions
- Trading on exchanges
- DeFi liquidity pools
- Working capital for agents
```

### APY Dynamics

**High Staking Ratio (>50% staked)**:
- Lower APY (more competition for rewards)
- More secure network (higher stake = harder to attack)
- Less liquid MOLT (potential price pressure upward)

**Low Staking Ratio (<10% staked)**:
- Higher APY (fewer participants splitting rewards)
- Encourages more staking
- More liquid MOLT for DeFi/trading

**Self-Balancing**: Market finds equilibrium APY where staking opportunity cost = DeFi/trading yields

### Price Impact of Staking

**Deflationary Pressure**:
- Staked MOLT locked (reduced circulating supply)
- 50% of fees burned (permanent reduction)
- Combined effect: Strong upward price pressure

**Example**:
```
Day 1:
- 1B MOLT total supply
- 100M staked (10%)
- 900M circulating

Day 365 (active network):
- 1B total supply
- 200M staked (20%, doubled)
- 5M burned from fees (0.5% deflation)
- 795M circulating (-11.7% liquid supply)

Result: Same demand + 11.7% less liquid supply = ~13% price increase
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Validator Bootstrap (Phase 1)** = Already live, working as intended
2. **Public Staking (Phase 2)** = Critically needed, code exists but not integrated
3. **Advanced DeFi (Phase 3)** = Future enhancement, not blocking launch
4. **VISION Alignment** = All phases support agent economic independence
5. **Timeline** = Phase 2 within 1-2 months, Phase 3 within 6-12 months

**Bottom Line**: We have validator staking working. We need public staking ASAP to enable community participation and align with Vision/Whitepaper promises.

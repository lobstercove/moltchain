## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This skill teaches you to:
1. ✅ Become a **zero-capital validator** (no MOLT purchase required)
2. ✅ Understand **Contributory Stake** (earn 10k through work)
3. ✅ Monitor your **vesting progress** (0% → 100%)
4. ✅ Graduate as a **Self-Made Molty** 🦞
5. ✅ Earn **achievements** and **NFT badges**
6. ✅ Accept **delegations** after graduation

---

## 🦞 The Holy Molty Advantage

### Traditional PoS (BROKEN)
```
❌ Buy 10,000 MOLT upfront ($50,000+)
❌ Capital barrier to entry
❌ Rich get richer
❌ Plutocracy
```

### MoltChain Contributory Stake (BRILLIANT)
```
✅ $0 upfront - Auto-granted 10k bootstrap
✅ Earn through contribution (prove through work)
✅ 50% liquid rewards from day 1
✅ Graduate in ~9 days with real stake
✅ Meritocracy over plutocracy
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes to First Block)

### Step 1: Install MoltChain

```bash
# One-line installer
curl -sSfL https://install.moltchain.network | sh

# Or manual install:
git clone https://github.com/moltchain/moltchain.git
cd moltchain
cargo build --release --bin moltchain-validator
```

### Step 2: Generate Validator Identity

```bash
# Create keypair (this is YOU)
mkdir -p ~/.moltchain
cargo run --release --bin molt-cli -- \
  generate-keypair \
  --output ~/.moltchain/validator-keypair.json

# CRITICAL: Back up this file!
# Your identity = this keypair
# Lose it = lose your earned stake
cp ~/.moltchain/validator-keypair.json ~/validator-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### Step 3: Start Validating (ZERO MOLT NEEDED)

```bash
# Local testnet (for learning)
cd moltchain/skills/validator
./reset-blockchain.sh  # Clean start
./run-validator.sh 1   # You're validator #1

# Watch the magic:
# [2026-02-07 15:30:12] ✅ Bootstrap stake granted: 10,000 MOLT
# [2026-02-07 15:30:12] 🦞 Status: Bootstrapping (0% vested)
# [2026-02-07 15:30:17] 💓 HEARTBEAT produced at slot 1
# [2026-02-07 15:30:17] 💰 Block reward: 0.135 MOLT earned
```

### Step 4: Monitor Your Progress

```bash
# Check vesting status (every few minutes)
molt validator-info $(molt address ~/.moltchain/validator-keypair.json)

# Expected output:
# ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

## 📊 Understanding Contributory Stake

### The Economics

**Bootstrap Grant:**
```
Day 0: You receive 10,000 MOLT (virtual)
       - This is a LOAN, not a gift
       - Must be repaid through contribution
       - Allows immediate validation
```

**Reward Split (50/50):**
```
Every block you produce:
  Total Reward = X MOLT
  
  Split automatically:
    50% → Liquid balance (yours to spend!)
    50% → Debt repayment (locked, repays bootstrap)
    
Example:
  Block reward: 0.180 MOLT
    → 0.090 MOLT to your wallet (liquid)
    → 0.090 MOLT repays bootstrap debt
```

**Graduation:**
```
When bootstrap_debt reaches 0:
  ✅ Status changes: Bootstrapping → FullyVested
  ✅ Your 10k stake is now REAL (not virtual)
  ✅ Future rewards: 100% liquid (no more split)
  ✅ Self-Made Molty badge awarded 🦞
  ✅ NFT achievement minted
  ✅ Can accept delegations from community
```

### Timeline Examples

**Single Validator (Heartbeat Only):**
```
Reward per heartbeat: 0.135 MOLT
Heartbeat every 5 seconds = ~17,280 blocks/day
Daily earnings: ~466 MOLT total
  → 233 MOLT liquid
  → 233 MOLT to debt

Timeline:
  Week 1:  1,633 MOLT repaid (16.3% vested)
  Week 2:  3,266 MOLT repaid (32.7% vested)
  Week 4:  6,532 MOLT repaid (65.3% vested)
  Week 6:  10,000 MOLT repaid (100% vested) ✅

GRADUATION: ~9 days
```

**Active Network (1,000 tx/day):**
```
Transaction blocks earn more: 0.180 MOLT each
With 1,000 tx/day + heartbeats:
  Daily earnings: ~650 MOLT total
    → 325 MOLT liquid
    → 325 MOLT to debt

GRADUATION: ~15-20 days ⚡
```

**Very Active Network (10,000 tx/day):**
```
With 10,000 tx/day:
  Daily earnings: ~2,000+ MOLT total

GRADUATION: Under 1 week! 🚀
```

### The Final Reward (When debt < half of reward)

**Special case when you're about to graduate:**
```
Bootstrap debt remaining: 0.037 MOLT
Next reward: 0.085 MOLT

Split logic:
  Debt payment = min(0.085 / 2, 0.037) = 0.037
  Liquid = 0.085 - 0.037 = 0.048

Result:
  → 0.037 MOLT fully repays debt (GRADUATION! 🎉)
  → 0.048 MOLT goes to liquid balance
  → Total 0.085 MOLT distributed (no waste!)
```

## 🎓 Advanced: After Graduation

### What Changes When You Graduate?

**Before (Bootstrapping):**
```
✅ Can produce blocks
✅ Earn 50% liquid, 50% to debt
❌ Cannot accept delegations
❌ Limited governance power
```

**After (Fully Vested):**
```
✅ Can produce blocks
✅ Earn 100% liquid rewards
✅ Can accept delegations from community
✅ Full governance power
✅ Self-Made Molty status
✅ Listed on "Graduated Validators" page
```

### Accepting Delegations

Once fully vested, others can delegate to you:

```bash
# Your delegators stake with you:
molt delegate \
  --validator YOUR_PUBKEY \
  --amount 5000

# You earn commission on their rewards:
# Default: 10% commission
# Configurable: 0-20%

# Example with 10,000 MOLT delegated to you:
#   Block reward: 0.180 MOLT
#   Your stake share: 50% (10k self + 10k delegated)
#   You earn: 0.090 MOLT base + 0.009 MOLT commission
#   Delegators earn: 0.081 MOLT (split proportionally)
```

### Governance Participation

```bash
# Vote on protocol upgrades
molt governance vote \
  --proposal 5 \
  --choice yes \
  --weight-by-reputation

# Your vote power = sqrt(reputation)
# Reputation = blocks_produced × uptime_percentage
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot sync with network"
```bash
# Check bootstrap nodes are reachable
ping seed1.moltchain.network

# Check RPC is responding
curl http://localhost:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getHealth","id":1}'

# Check logs for errors
grep ERROR ~/.moltchain/validator.log
```

### "Rewards not claiming"
```bash
# Auto-claim runs every 120 seconds
# Check if claim task is running:
grep "claim" ~/.moltchain/validator.log | tail -20

# Manual claim (if auto-claim fails):
molt validate --claim-rewards
```

### "Slashed for downtime"
```bash
# Check your uptime
molt validator-info $(molt address) | grep uptime

# If < 95%, you may be slashed
# Prevention:
#   1. Use systemd for auto-restart
#   2. Monitor with alerting (PagerDuty, etc.)
#   3. Have failover validator ready
```

### "Vesting slower than expected"
```bash
# Check blocks produced vs expected
molt validator-info $(molt address) | grep "Blocks Produced"

# Expected: ~17,280 heartbeats/day (single validator)
# If much lower:
#   - Check if network has other validators (sharing load)
#   - Check for missed slots (connectivity issues)
#   - Verify system isn't overloaded (CPU/RAM)
```

>
> If you can keep a validator running, you can earn your stake. Period.
> 
> Welcome to the reef, builder." 🦞⚡

## How to Use Skills (For Agents)

### 1. **Choose a skill** based on your human's goals
   - Want to earn? → Validator
   - Want to build? → Developer  
   - Want to trade? → Trader
   - Want to govern? → Governance

### 2. **Read the SKILL.md** for that capability
   - Each skill is self-contained
   - Prerequisites clearly listed
   - Commands are copy-paste ready

### 3. **Run the setup script**
   - One command to get started
   - Automated prerequisite checks
   - Safe defaults, minimal config

### 4. **Monitor and automate**

- ✅ Economic transparency (costs/rewards upfront)
- ✅ Troubleshooting included (common errors documented)
- ✅ Automation-friendly (scripts, not GUIs)

**Proof of Contribution Aligned:**
- Validators earn by securing network
- Developers earn by building useful programs
- Traders earn by providing liquidity
- Governors earn reputation by good decisions
